"work-related death, unless he either was mentally or physically incapacitated or proved dependence on his wife’s earnings, but granted a widow death benefits without her having to prove dependence on her husband’s earnings. The Court recognized that “the statute discriminates against both men and women.” Id. at 147, 100 S.Ct. at 1543. It discriminated against widowers vis-a-vis similarly situated widows and discriminated against female wage earners vis-a-vis similarly situated male wage earners. The Court did not reject the equal protection claim simply because under the discriminatory law, some women (widows) fared better while others (wage earners) fared worse than they would have fared under a gender-neutral law. The relevant inquiry was how women fared compared to similarly situated men. See also  REDACTED Wein-berger v. Wiesenfeld, 420 U.S. 636, 651-53, 95 S.Ct. 1225, 1234-35, 43 L.Ed.2d 514 (1975). Since the use of gender-distinct tables causes the present value of the reversion-ary interests of all female decedents to be higher than the present value of the rever-sionary interests of all similarly situated male decedents and therefore increases the likelihood that the trusts created by female decedents will be included in their gross estates and consequently taxed, the use of these tables is a discrimination based on gender. Whether that discrimination is unconstitutional under the Equal Protection Clause is a different issue, to which I now turn. II. Is the Discrimination Unconstitutional?

There existed in the office of the collector of internal revenue at the time of the enactment, a custom under which, where a claim in abatement was filed, collection of the tax was voluntarily stayed until the matter was passed upon by the Commissioner, of Internal Revnue. This stay, of course, was voluntary, and could be violated by the collector at will.

"verdict does not give extra weight or a presumption of validity to the defendant’s motion for acquittal. United States v. Reis, 788 F.2d 54, 56 (1st Cir.1986). Therefore, the defendant’s motion for judgment of acquittal is DENIED. B. The Motion to Dismiss the Indictment The defendant moves to dismiss the Indictment because I declared a mistrial over the defendant’s objection. He argues that a subsequent retrial would violate the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution because there was no manifest necessity that warranted the declaration of a mistrial. I find that there was manifest necessity for the mistrial, and I DENY the defendant’s motion to dismiss. It is within the sound discretion of the district court to declare a mistrial.  REDACTED United States v. Barbioni, 62 F.3d 5, 7 (1st Cir.1995). The district court may declare a mistrial over the defendant’s objection “if it determines that there is a ‘manifest necessity’ for a mistrial.... ” Barbioni, 62 F.3d at 7 (quoting United States v. Ramirez, 884 F.2d 1524, 1528 (1st Cir.1989)). If manifest necessity existed to declare a mistrial, the general rule that a “retrial following the ‘hung jury’ does not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause” will apply. Richardson v.

"person would “believe that the agent is violating the orders of the principal or that the principal would not wish the agent to act under the circumstances known to the agent, he cannot subject the principal to liability.” LaRoche, 62 F.Supp.2d at 1373. The argument, therefore, is that because the racial epithet allegedly made here “at best, amounts to the possibility that a server personally refused to serve Plaintiffs!,]” (Def.’s Mem. in Supp. at 19), a reasonable person would not believe that Waffle House would approve of or otherwise facilitate the action because management was not involved. While this argument is clear on its face, the court is not persuaded because La-Roche may no longer be reliable precedent. Indeed, in  REDACTED  the Fifth Circuit reversed the district court decision upon, which the LaRoche court relied and held that managerial involvement is not necessary for liability to attach in a discrimination action. In so deciding, the Fifth Circuit observed that while limiting liability largely to the acts of supervisors is appropriate in the employment discrimination arena, the same cannot be said in the public accommodation context because of the ill effects it might have for potential plaintiffs. Specifically, the Arguello court held that, in a public accommodation case under § 1981, a rule that only actions by supervisors are imputed to the employer would result, in most cases, in a no liability rule.

The clear purpose and objective of section 202(g), supra, in its application to a case of this kind is to extend mother’s benefits to a former wife divorced whose economic relationship to the insured wage earner was such that she sustained economic loss arising out of his death.

She was renting two rooms in the residence. And she was using the rentals for her own support and maintenance. But all of that continued without change or interruption after the death of the wage earner. After his death, she continued to be the owner of the property, continued to rent the rooms, and continued to use the rentals for her support and maintenance.

We agree with the Government that Carbe’s notice of appeal, dated December 2, 2015, was not timely as to the August order granting his motion to reduce his sentence. Although Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(b) is not jurisdictional, a defendant may not have his untimeliness disregarded when the Government timely objects, as is the case here.

Indeed, once granted the remedy is not exclusive, even if neither Michigan nor the foreign jurisdiction had a procedural statute, and granting the suit is otherwise properly maintainable in either jurisdiction, then either jurisdiction may permit access to its own forums.

See  REDACTED 5 S. Ct. 497, 28 L. Ed. 991. Defendant has stressed the point that the statute now invoked by the plaintiff's was enacted sixty-seven years ago, and that the reported eases of the state of Michigan fail to contain a single decision during all that period where anyone has sought to invoke the statute as have the plaintiffs. While this fact is noteworthy, it concludes nothing other than that a court outside of the state of Michigan should be careful to see that no construction is placed upon the statute which does violence to what its language, fairly construed, must be taken to have intended.

The boundary that emerges from such decisions approximates the line between public transactions that involve the clearance and settlement process and non-public transactions that do not involve that process.

"speech. The First Amendment challenge was twofold: First, the Charities claimed that subsections two and three of Section 2001.456 are facially unconstitutional because they are a direct abridgement of speech with no compelling or substantial justifying interest. Second, they claimed the law unconstitutionally discriminates between the Charities and similarly situated businesses, such as racetracks, which are not prohibited from using their revenue for political purposes. In light of the then-upcoming legislative session, the Charities moved for entry of a preliminary injunction barring enforcement of the political speech restrictions in Section 2001.456(2)-(3). The district court granted the Charities’ request on October 29, 2010 and explained its reasoning in an extensive opinion. Relying heavily on the Supreme Court’s opinion in  REDACTED  the district court concluded that the restrictions in Section 2001.456 violate the First Amendment because they burden political speech and fail to satisfy strict scrutiny. The district court also concluded that the restrictions are unconstitutional conditions because they require that, as a condition of participating in the state’s charitable bingo program, the Charities not exercise their right to engage in political speech. The Charities moved for summary judgment, which the district court granted, permanently enjoining the Commission from enforcing the invalid provisions. The Commission appealed.

"de novo. United States v. Black, 125 F.3d 454, 458 (7th Cir.1997). Tuner asserts that 18 U.S.C. § 1033 (which makes it illegal for employees to embezzle — among other things — from insurance companies) exceeds Congress’ power under the Commerce Clause, criminalizing a wholly intrastate activity. Turner’s specific argument is' that: (1) criminal acts are not encompassed within the Commerce Clause power, and (2) even though insurance affects interstate commerce, his conduct, which merely affected the insurance company, did not directly affect interstate commerce and cannot be regulated. A. The Poiver to Regulate Interstate Commerce The Court has enunciated three broad categories of activities that Congress may regulate using the power delegated to it in the Commerce Clause. E.g.,  REDACTED First, Congress may regulate the channels of interstate commerce. Id. Channels refer to the transportation of a commodity or travel in interstate commerce.

"has a readily ascertainable and reasonably specific meaning. It is also significant that there is only one federal anti-rioting statute. The federal anti-rioting statute prohibits the use of the channels and instrumentalities of commerce to incite, encourage or participate in a riot, which is defined in part as “an act or acts of violence ... which ... constitute a clear and present danger of, or ... resultes] in, damage or injury to the property ... or ... person of any other individual.” 18 U.S.C. §§ 2101-2102. To be sure, it is a broad criminal statute that prohibits a wide variety of conduct. However, it provides more than adequate notice as to the conduct that is prohibited by its terms.

Thus, reference to the criminality of rioting was sufficient to provide context to the Warrants. Moreover, the particularity inquiry must naturally focus on the effect of the terms of a warrant upon the executing agents, i.e., whether agents can reasonably understand and implement a warrant’s terms, not the untrained, general public. The executing law enforcement officials were entitled to use their experience in investigating such criminal activity to make rational and informed judgments as to whether a particular item was related to rioting activity.

Katz, 178 F.3d 368 (5th Cir.1999) (per curiam), but Katz merely held that the potential need for expert testimony “must be determined on a case by case basis” and that, in the circumstances of that case, expert testimony “may well be necessary.” Id. at 873; see also  REDACTED For six reasons, we conclude that, even though the individual shown in the videos is post-pubescent, this is not a case that requires expert testimony. First, the district court was not confronted with the task of discerning age on the basis of a single or even several static images. Rather, the court viewed videos in which Victim C moved about a room and spoke back and forth with Batchu. Her attire, gait, demeanor, bearing, expressions, and voice were all subject to assessment, as too was the substance of her conversations with Batchu. An assessment of age based on",473705

It is defendant’s contention that the letter from the Department of Agriculture of March 5, 1947, was a denial of plaintiff’s claim under Section 6 of the Lucas Act and that plaintiff did not, within six months of such denial, file a petition in court as required by Section 6 of the Act.

In this case, Arthur believes it would have been reasonable under the circumstances for him to trade positions with another employee because ASI retained the right to transfer employees at will. Though a transfer or reassignment to another position is recognized as one type of reasonable accommodation, the ADA does not refer to merely any position, but “a vacant position.” 42 U.S.C. § 12111(9)(B) (emphasis added). Here, none of the positions amenable to Arthur’s restrictions were vacant at the time he was offered a position.

Brown asserts that she was treated differently than Chandler, a Caucasian male, in that although both Brown and Chandler missed time from work due to extenuating circumstances during their respective probationary periods, Brown was terminated while Chandler was retained after their respective probationary periods ended. The Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals has determined that to establish a prima facie case of employment discrimination, a plaintiff must establish by a preponderance of the evidence that: (1) she is a member of a protected class; (2) she is qualified for the position; (3) adverse action was taken against her; and (4) the action occurred in circumstances giving rise to an inference of discriminatory motivation.

"Procedure allows a party to raise the defense of the court’s “lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter” by motion. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1).

McDonnell, 299 F.3d 1173, 1180 (10th Cir. 2002). On a facial attack, a plaintiff is afforded safeguards similar to those provided in opposing a rule 12(b)(6) motion: the court must consider the complaint’s allegations to be true. See Ruiz v. McDonnell, 299 F.3d at 1180;  REDACTED But when the attack is aimed at the jurisdictional facts themselves, a district court may not presume the truthfulness of those allegations.

"retaliation claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 must establish that the government responded to the plaintiffs constitutionally protected activity with conduct or speech that would chill or adversely affect his protected activity. See Constantine v. Rectors and Visitors of George Mason Unm, 411 F.3d 474, 499 (4th Cir.2005); ACLU v. Wicomico County, 999 F.2d 780, 785 (4th Cir.1993). The determination of whether government conduct or speech has a chilling effect or an adverse impact is an objective one — we determine whether a similarly situated person of “ordinary firmness” reasonably would be chilled by the government conduct in light of the circumstances presented in the particular case. See Constantine, 411 F.3d at 500; Wicomico County, 999 F.2d at 786; see also  REDACTED Because our analysis of the adverse impact is objective, it can be resolved as a matter of law. “Not every [government] restriction,” however, “is sufficient to chill the exercise of First Amendment rights, nor is every restriction actionable, even if retaliatory.” DiMeglio v. Haines, 45 F.3d 790, 806 (4th Cir.1995). Illustrating the observation that “not every [government] restriction is sufficient to chill the exercise of First Amendment rights,” we have recognized a distinction between an adverse impact that is actionable, on the one hand, and a de minimis inconvenience, on the other. “[A] plaintiff seeking to recover for retaliation must show that the defendant’s conduct resulted in something more than a ‘de",330534
"that a debtor may cure and reinstate a home mortgage until the property is sold in a foreclosure sale. This attempt by Congress to clarify when the debtor loses his right to cure a defaulted mortgage has been unsuccessful. Some courts have declared that the language of U.S.C. § 1322(c)(1) is clear and unambiguous. These courts have followed the bright-line approach that the cure provisions of 11 U.S.C. § 1322 are only available prior to the date of the foreclosure auction. See, e.g., McCarn v. WyHy Fed. Credit Union (In re McCarn), 218 B.R. 154, 161 (10th Cir. BAP 1998); Cottrell v. United States (In re Cottrell), 213 B.R. 378, 381 (Bankr.M.D.Ala.1996) (quoting In re Smith, 85 F.3d 1555 (11th Cir.1996));  REDACTED In re Sims, 185 B.R. 853, 865-66 (Bankr.N.D.Ala.1995). Other courts have found the language of 11 U.S.C. § 1322(c)(1) ambiguous and have resorted to an analysis of legislative history to resolve the ambiguity. These courts generally favor a more liberal statutory interpretation that a debtor’s right to cure is severed at the point when the foreclosure sale, as distinguished from the auction, has been completed under state law. See, e.g., Christian v. Citibank, 214 B.R. 352, 355 (N.D.Ill.1997); In re Downing, 212 B.R. 459, 461 (Bankr.D.N.J.1997); In re Ross, 191 B.R. 615, 618 (Bankr.D.N.J.1996); In re Barham, 193 B.R. 229, 231-32 (Bankr.E.D.N.C.1996); In re Reid, 200 B.R. 265 (Bankr.S.D.Fla.1996) (quoting In re Jaar, 186 B.R. 148 (Bankr.M.D.Fla.1995)); In re Blair, 196",331945

The attorney-client privilege protects communications between clients and their attorneys, thus encouraging an open dialogue. See Harding v. Dana Transport, Inc., 914 F.Supp. at 1097. In contrast, the work product doctrine maintains legal professionalism by precluding attorneys from capitalizing on an adversary’s work efforts.

Ordinance 13-77 essentially bans people from congregating and/or loitering on traffic islands, medians and other like public ways under circumstances where such conduct could prove distracting to drivers and pedestrians.

"the Wyncote loan, subsequent payment on its bond, and obtaining a judgment against the Roecos constituted predicate acts under RICO, (4) whether the several predicate acts alleged against Commonwealth meet the “continuity and relationship” tests of RICO’s “pattern” requirement, and (5) whether any of the alleged predicate acts caused any damage to the Roecos. Plaintiffs’ arguments on most of these issues (with the possible exception of the fourth) are quite weak. However, plaintiffs’ claims fail on broader grounds which can be simply addressed. (1) As courts have interpreted § 1962(b), the type of control required is that which would give the racketeering enterprise the power to affect the composition of the board of directors of the affected business,  REDACTED  or the day-to-day operation of the business.

"decision in Old Dominion Stevedoring Corporation v. United States, D.C., 130 F.Supp. 662. Aside from the fact that th'e Contracting Officer addressed his letter to the wrong corporation, it is abundantly clear that this letter requesting a “voluntary return” of $4,821.34 is not a decision in writing of a “dispute” within the meaning of Article 16. The question here presented affords even more logical reasoning to rule against the Government than that as existed in the Old Dominion Stevedoring Corporation case. Indeed, it is extremely doubtful whether any administrative remedy existed at the time the Contracting Officer wrote his letter. Southeastern Oil Florida, Inc. v. United States, 115 F.Supp. 198, 127 Ct. Cl. 480. See also:  REDACTED James Graham Mfg. Co. v. United States, D.C., 91 F.Supp. 715. If the United States is correct in its contention, then the item of $4,~ 821.34 requested in the form of a voluntary return becomes final, and there is no-reason for merely deducting $2,000 from a partial payment due plaintiff on a subsequent contract. The Court has had an opportunity to view several decisions of Contracting Officers which are positive determinations of disputes and which follow the letter of the “dispute” provision of the contract.

Prospective juror Leach volunteered that she would put herself in the place of petitioner when considering the case, making her a less than ideal prosecution witness (V.1281). Prospective juror Mannyofe did volunteer work, which, like certain occupations in social work or counseling, might make him “a more suitable target” for a peremptory challenge than those who did not volunteer. See United States v. Alvarado, 951 F.2d 22, 25 (2d Cir.1991) (accepting prosecution’s race-neutral reason for striking juror that her occupation as a social worker made her a less desirable juror). Prospective jurors Handelman and Blair were legal secretaries who may have claimed greater knowledge of the legal system than other members of the jury (V.691-92, 1436-37).

These courts held that a showing of reliance was critical to plaintiffs’ common law fraud and misrepresentation claims. Because the proof of reliance would be required of each individual class member in order for the common law claims to proceed, the courts found that individual issues predominated, precluding class certification. Plaintiffs respond that many courts have certified pendant state law claims of negligent misrepresentation in federal securities law class actions, and cite In re Towers Fin. Corp. Noteholders Litig., 177 F.R.D. 167 (S.D.N.Y.1997), In re Regal Commun. Corp. Sec. Litig., 1995 WL 550454 (E.D.Pa.

(Resp. at 17). Plaintiffs’ reliance on In re Towers for the proposition that many courts have certified pendant state law claims of negligent misrepresentation in securities fraud class actions is misplaced. In re Towers involved an uncontested class certification motion, to which no objections were filed in response to a magistrate judge’s recommendation that the district court grant the motion to certify the class. Moreover, in certifying the class, the court did not discuss the question of the class members’ individual reliance on the representations at issue. The court summarily concluded the",473570

To be sure, Mr. Schurz’s testimony was self-serving and, given the time lapse, rather dubious. But “[w]hen a jury has chosen to credit crucial testimony with full knowledge of the many faults of the witness providing it,” the court has “no basis to interfere.”  REDACTED And although Mr. Kuhn’s testimony was corroborated by his own letters and memoranda, the jury might have concluded that those documents were merely the boilerplate of an overworked IRS agent going through the motions. Indeed, the jury might have wondered why the IRS would have kept Mr. Kuhn’s worthless notes but destroyed a document which proved the enforceability of an assessment worth several hundred thousand dollars. In short, ample evidence supports the jury’s verdict. The United States’ motion for judgment as a matter of law or for a new trial is hereby DENIED. II.

We have carefully reviewed the record, the applicable law, and the parties’ briefs, and conclude the district court reached the correct result. We have repeatedly opined that “when a lower court accurately takes the measure of a case and articulates a cogent rationale, it serves no useful purpose for a reviewing court to write at length.” Seaco Ins. Co. v. Davis-Irish, 300 F.3d 84, 86 (1st Cir.2002) (citing cases). Thus, we affirm the district court’s judgment for substantially the reasons set forth in its opinion. We add only these brief comments. The Supreme Court’s decision in  REDACTED  dictates the outcome of this case. In Ridgway, the issue was whether a serviceman’s beneficiary designation under a policy governed by the Servicemen’s Group Life Insurance Act (SGLIA), 38 U.S.C. §§ 1965-1979, prevailed over a constructive trust (based on a divorce decree) which a state court imposed upon the policy proceeds. Like FEGLIA, SGLIA establishes a specified “order of precedence” for policy beneficiaries. Subsection (a) of both 5 U.S.C. § 8705 and 38 U.S.C. § 1970 provides that policy proceeds shall first be paid to the insured’s properly designated beneficiary.

"employers to pay compensation for meal times unless the employee is “completely relieved from duty.” 29 C.F.R. § 553.223. Because a jury found that plaintiffs were not completely relieved of their duties during meal times, plaintiffs were owed compensation for their meal time under the FLSA. Lamon II, 972 F.2d at 1155-57. The meal time at issue fell in the “gap” and therefore the Court determined the rate of compensation for such time. In determining the amount of back pay owed to the plaintiffs, the District Court rejected the defendants’ argument that it could be paid at the minimum wage, stating that it found that argument “to be unreasonable in view of the remedial purpose of the FLSA.”  REDACTED Rather, the court found “the requirement that plaintiffs be paid compensation at their regular hourly rate to be implicit in the framework of the FLSA.” Id. Affirming the district court on appeal, the Tenth Circuit stated that “compensation for meal periods at a rate less than a regular rate would be contrary to the FLSA.” Id. at 1155.

"This is the general rule, but it does not assist in reaching a solution here as the acts of the parties or either of them do not point to a construction of the whole writing.

Instead, when the notation taken as a whole is considered together with the appellant’s knowledge of the early drilling contract, and the fact Okan was the operator, we are clearly led to the conclusion that the notation constituted notice of possible defenses. The entire notation must so be considered and given consistent effect if possible, as was done by the trial court.  REDACTED .

According to the loss table, damage valued at more than $20,000 warrants an additional six offense levels, but $40,000 warrants seven. The court used the $21,000 figure and added an additional seventh offense level for Cox’s endangerment of public welfare and his prior conduct with regard to explosive devices. II. ANALYSIS A. Sentencing Departure We review the district court’s legal interpretations of the Guidelines de novo.  REDACTED In United States v.

"the district court held that the trial judge misapplied the Witherspoon test. On this basis the district court found that deference to a state court finding of fact was not appropriate where such a finding was based on a misapplication of federal law. See Gray v. Mississippi, 481 U.S. 648, 661 n. 10, 107 S.Ct. 2045, 2053 n. 10, 95 L.Ed.2d 622 (1987). Because the district court felt the state court applied an incorrect legal standard it concluded that the factual finding was not fairly supported by the record and did not apply the presumption of correctness thereto. See 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(8). At the time of Hulsey’s trial in 1975 the state court was acting under its interpretation of Witherspoon.  REDACTED  and Witt had not been decided. If the strict requirements of Witherspoon were deemed controlling we would have serious concerns about the state trial court’s application of that standard. Mrs. Creamer’s equivocal answers would seem to challenge the requirements espoused in Witherspoon that the juror’s bias against the death penalty be “unmistakably clear,” such that the juror would automatically vote against the death penalty. This was, of course, the district court’s understandable response in its first opinion.

"(S.D.N.Y. October 4, 2002). Such a motion is to be granted freely, “in the absence of undue delay, bad faith, dilatory motive or undue prejudice.” Belgrave v. Pena, 254 F.3d 384, 387 (2d Cir.2001). The circumstances here lead the court to conclude that Defendants should be al lowed to assert the affirmative defense of failure to exhaust. Although a trial date has been set, consideration of the exhaustion issue requires no further discovery or other pretrial proceedings. Additionally, Defendants cannot be accused of undue delay or dilatory conduct in failing to raise the defense earlier. When this case was commenced, the law in the Second Circuit was that exhaustion was not required in cases alleging individual instances of excessive force. See  REDACTED The Supreme Court case reversing the Second Circuit, and holding that exhaustion is required in cases alleging excessive force, was not decided until February of 2002. See Porter v. Nussle, 534 U.S. 516, 531, 122 S.Ct. 983, 152 L.Ed.2d 12 (2002). Thus, the affirmative defense was not available to be asserted in this case until 2002 and Defendants cannot therefore be faulted for failing to earlier raise the defense. See Porter, 534 U.S. at 531, 122 S.Ct. 983 (reversing Second Circuit holding that PLRA exhaustion requirement for claims involving “prison conditions” does not include particular incidents of excessive force). For the foregoing reasons, the court holds that it is appropriate to allow Defendants to assert the exhaustion defense and turns",79309
"this provision entitles a debtor to exclude from property of the estate any interest in a plan or trust that contains a transfer restriction enforceable under any relevant nonbankruptey law. Nothing in § 541 suggests that the Phrase ‘applicable nonbankruptcy law* refers, as petitioner contends, exclusively to state law. The text contains no limitation on ‘applicable nonbankruptcy law’ relating to the source of the law. ... Plainly read, the provision encompasses any relevant nonbankruptcy law, including federal law such as ERISA. We must enforce the statute according to its terms.” The court then went on to hold that ERISA qualified plans were excluded from the estate, as the required transfer restrictions fell within the requirements of 541(c)(2). In the case of  REDACTED  the court determined that the debtor’s pension plan was not ex-cludable under I.R.C. § 401(a)(13), as a reading of the statute established that it did not create any substantive rights that a beneficiary or participant of a qualified retirement trust could enforce. Therefore, the Plan did not fall within § 541(c)(2) and accordingly, was not excluded from the estate. In this regal’d, the court stated, in pertinent part: The provisions of I.R.C. § 401(a) relate solely to the criteria for tax qualification under the Internal Revenue Code.

Accordingly, the district court ruled that the Secretary’s disallowance of stock maintenance costs had no rational basis. Because we conclude, on the contrary, that the Secretary’s decision does rest on a rational basis, we reverse the district court’s judgment. II Before addressing the merits of this action, we consider NME’s claim that the Secretary is collaterally estopped from re- litigating the stock maintenance cost issue because NME or its privies already successfully litigated the issue in the previous Claims Court action. See NME, 11 Cl.Ct. at 329. Neither party disputes the well-established rule that nonmutual offensive collateral estoppel cannot be asserted against the government.

Actual input prices paid, however, are not necessarily public information. See Allied Pac. Food (Dalian) Co. v. United States, 30 CIT 736, 761-62, 435 F.

The economic loss rule has never been expressly adopted by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, but it has been consistently applied by the Pennsylvania Superior Court. See Lower Lake Dock Co. v. Messinger Bearing Corp., 395 Pa.Super. 456, 577 A.2d 631 (1990); New York State Electric & Gas Corp. v. Westinghouse Electric Corp., 387 Pa.Super. 537, 564 A.2d 919 (1989); REM Coal Company, Inc. v.

The district court found insufficient evidence to conclude that Weiss knowingly or recklessly withheld material information from the purchasers. The purchasers, however, assert on appeal that Weiss acted with reckless disregard of the truth when he failed to disclose information contained in the August 13, 1968, memorandum. Assuming without deciding that reckless conduct can result in a § 10(b) liability, we agree with the trial court that the evidence does not support a finding that Weiss’ conduct was intentional within the requirements of the Act.

"of those competing interpretations is most plausible. This case is a textbook example of the principle that the meaning of an ambiguous word is known by its companions — the doctrine of noscitur a sociis. Both the Supreme Court and this Court have frequently relied on this commonsense principle to ascertain the meaning of ambiguous statutory provisions “in order to avoid the giving of unintended breadth to the Acts of Congress.” Jarecki v.

"Lee v. Schweiker; In re Tidewater Memorial Hospital, Inc. To support its asserted right of recoupment, the Secretary usually offers two theories. One is that the recoupment right is statutory and is derived from the federal medicare provisions. See generally In re Memorial Hospital of Iowa County, Inc., 82 B.R. at 482; In re Neuman, 55 B.R. 702, 706 (S.D.N.Y.1985). The second approach is that there is a contractual right to recoupment. This contractual right is preserved, the Secretary uniformly argues, because the medicare provider contract is executory and the debtor has either expressly or impliedly assumed the contract. See generally In re Advanced Professional Home Health Care, Inc.; In re Monsour Medical Center, 11 B.R. 1014 (W.D.Pa.1981);  REDACTED  aff'd, 34 B.R. 385 (S.D.N.Y.1983).

Toombs, 139 F.3d 1102, 1104 (6th Cir.1998). The prisoner has the burden of demonstrating that he has exhausted these remedies. Brown, 139 F.3d at 1104. To establish that he has exhausted his administrative remedies prior to filing suit, the prisoner should attach the decision containing the administrative disposition of his grievance to the complaint, or in the absence of written documentation, describe with specificity the administrative proceeding and its outcome.  REDACTED Mitchell has not met his burden of demonstrating that he fully exhausted all of his administrative remedies. Mitchell argued, in his complaint, that he had pursued his rights under the grievance system and that he had “exhausted” his remedies because he informed the prison officials that failure to respond in a timely fashion would “be deemed as exhaustion of plaintiffs administrative remedies.” However, Mitchell has not attached any documentation revealing what particular claims were presented in the grievances or any response to such claims. Nor has he described with specificity the administrative proceedings concerning his grievances. Hence, the district court properly dismissed the complaint.

"Inc., 931 F.2d 655, 663 n. 11 (10th Cir.1991). According to Fed. R.Civ.P. 50(a), specific grounds are required for a motion for directed verdict. At the close of evidence, KPL moved as follows: “At this time, the defendant ... moves for a directed verdict at the close of all the evidence, particularly on the claims of the plaintiff on the issue of misrepresentation.” Aplee.Supp.App. at 1226. Although we interpret Rule 50’s specificity requirement liberally, KPL’s motion was clearly insufficient as to the above issues. As such, KPL has failed to preserve its sufficiency of the evidence argument as to the breach of contract, re- tainage and alter ego claims. See Comcoa, Inc., 931 F.2d at 663 n. 11;  REDACTED Anderson v. Phillips Petroleum Co., 861 F.2d 631, 634 (10th Cir.1988). Furthermore, even had the error been properly preserved, we find the evidence sufficient to support the jury’s findings. KPL did move for a directed verdict on Seaboard Surety’s defense of no termination of contract. The jury did not reach the issue of Seaboard’s liability because it found no liability on the part of Green. Green’s liability was a prerequisite to Seaboard’s liability. Because we do not disturb the jury’s finding on Green’s liability, this issue is moot. IV.

"to gain or lose — the insurance company and the Illinois defendant — are diverse? Surely not. Nor do courts look past corporate form to the citizenship of the shareholders or other investors. There is a special rule for administrators of estates, 28 U.S.C. § 1332(c)(2), but normally the status of the named litigant governs — provided that the litigant is an entity rather than a name for an unincorporated association such as a partnership. See Carden v. Arkoma Associates, 494 U.S. 185, 110 S.Ct. 1015, 108 L.Ed.2d 157 (1990); Indiana Gas Co. v. Home Insurance Co., 141 F.3d 314 (7th Cir.1998). For example, the citizenship of a trustee rather than the trust beneficiary is dispositive under § 1332.  REDACTED Dow-ney cannot escape the same conclusion: Although a judgment against State Farm may come out of the federal treasury— creating a federal interest — the only litigants are in the private sector.

It is clear that the trial was not the topic discussed, but rather Thailand, where the witness was born, and its food, about which the court member had fond memories. The conversation while improper was harmless. Accord United States v. Henderson, 11 U.S.C.M.A. 556, 29 C.M.R. 372 (1960).

We are convinced that similar situations can be avoided in the future by the trial judge cautioning the members, during his preliminary instructions, to abstain from private communications of any kind with witnesses, officers of the court and third persons.

L. 103-322, § 40504, 108 Stat. 1796, 1947 (1994), we have joined other circuits in holding that the language “other expenses incurred during the participation in the investigation or prosecution” also authorizes the award of investigation costs and attorneys’ fees in some circumstances. See, e.g,, United States v. Abdelbary, 746 F.3d 570, 574-79 (4th Cir. 2014); United States v. Elson, 577 F.3d 713, 728 (6th Cir. 2009);  REDACTED United States v.

The answer to that question is found in Our observation that “calculating loss under the guidelines is not necessarily identical to loss calculation for purposes of restitution.” United States v. Hunter, 618 F.3d 1062, 1065 (9th Cir. 2010).

"investment universe of an ERISA 404(c) plan is a fiduciary function which, whether achieved through fiduciary designation or express plain language, is not a direct or necessary result of any participant direction of such plan.” Final Regulations Regarding Particular Directed Individual Account Plans (ERISA Section 404(c) Plans), 57 Fed.Reg. 46906-01, 46924 n. 27 (Oct. 13, 1992) (General Preamble). Relying on these provisions, plaintiffs argue that defendants are not entitled to a section 404(c) defense because the claims at issue challenge defendants’ designation of the Tyco Stock Fund as an investment option and the DOL has determined that fiduciaries are not shielded by section 404(c) from losses which result from such designation decisions. Defendants respond by noting that in  REDACTED  a divided Fifth Circuit panel declined to give effect to the DOL’s interpretation of its own regulations. I am unpersuaded by the Fifth Circuit’s reasoning, however, and instead agree with the dissent in that case that the DOL’s interpretation of its own regulations is reasonable and should not be ignored. See id. at 320-22 (Reavley, J., dissenting). Several factors lead me to this conclusion. First, section 404(c) is unclear as to whether it can be used to bar a claim based on a fiduciary’s designation of investment options. Second, section 404(c) requires the DOL to adopt regulations explaining when a participant or beneficiary has sufficient control over his assets to be subject to a section 404(c) defense. 29 U.S.C. §",488217
"useful guidance in applying general contract principles. Because both parties and the Court of Federal Claims have referred to this remedy as a “cover” remedy, this court will also use this term to refer to the remedy for Hughes’ increased costs of obtaining substitute launch services. The substitute goods or services involved in cover need not be identical to those involved in the contract, but they must be “commercially usable as reasonable substitutes under the circumstances.” U.C.C. § 2-712 cmt. 2. Whether cover provides a reasonable substitute under the circumstances is a question of fact. Bigelow-Sanford, Inc. v.

Importantly, Bergstrom does not allege that Commander Carroll called the police and requested that they arrest him. Therefore, the Yeksigian exception does not apply. Accordingly, Commander Carroll did not act under col- or of state law when he made false statements to the police. Bergstrom also alleges that Commander Carroll’s actions prolonged his unlawful seizure. The Fourth Amendment, however, does not create a right to be free from state actions that perpetuate lawful arrests. Gauger v. Hendle, 349 F.3d 354, 359 (7th Cir.2003) (citing McCullah v.

"the federal government running up litigation costs so that one can collect from another. And the statutory combination cited by the govern ment, creating “defendant” liability for attorneys’ fees while protecting “the Government” from such liability, can be explained by limiting the government’s exemption to appearances in its capacity as intervenor. In the end, none of these contextual arguments seems to offer any strong ground for interpretation of “person” one way or the other. We note that the circuits have split over whether “person” under the False Claims Act includes states. Compare United States ex rel. Long v. SCS Business & Tech.

The courts have necessarily resolved this question under the presumption established in the Will and Wilson cases; that two circuits found the presumption overcome in that context is a source of caution. But for state liability there was a stronger basis in the overall purpose and legislative history for inclusion, see, e.g., Long, 173 F.3d at 875-81, and the analysis was not subject to any interpretive guidance as strong as Nordic Village’s instruction that the presence of a “plausible” non-waiver interpretation compels rejection of a waiver interpretation.",695953

II. Discussion A. Subject Matter Jurisdiction As an initial matter, we reject the government’s contention that the district court’s dismissal of this action should be affirmed on the ground that federal question jurisdiction does not extend to the subject matter of the NTEU’s action.

"MEMORANDUM Princess Marian Haffner, a native and citizen of Sierra Leone, petitions this court for review of a Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) decision dismissing her appeal of an Immigration Judge’s (IJ’s) denial of her motion to reconsider the IJ’s closure of removal proceedings. As the parties are familiar with the facts, we discuss only those necessary to our analysis. We lack jurisdiction to review the BIA’s discretionary decision not to reopen the case sua sponte. Abassi v. INS, 305 F.3d 1028 (9th Cir.2002);  REDACTED We therefore dismiss Ms. Haffner’s petition insofar as it seeks review of that exercise of the BIA’s sua sponte discretion.

Because the BIA did not abuse its discretion in this case, we deny the remainder of Ms. Haffner’s petition.

"the agreement and found that the parties themselves mutually modified the agreement. Applying basic contract law principles is not outside the agreement since interpreting the agreement is completely within the arbitrator’s authority. See Misco, 108 S.Ct. at 371; Enterprise Wheel & Car, 363 U.S. at 597, 80 S.Ct. at 1361. Accordingly, the arbitrator did not unilaterally modify the agreement, nor did he ignore the express provisions of the contract, violating Section 1.08 of the agreement, as WPIX claims. The additional cases cited by WPIX, Georgia-Pacific Corp. v. Local 27, United Paper workers Int’l Union, 864 F.2d 940 (1st Cir.1988); Bruno’s, Inc. v.

Therefore, for all of the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the arbitrator interpreted the agreement in light of the conduct of the parties, and that it was within his authority to do so, and, thus, the award draws its essence from the agreement. This being a question of law, and there being no material facts which preclude resolving this question, the Union’s motion for summary judgment to enforce the arbitrator’s award is granted and WPIX’s motion to vacate the award is denied and its counterclaim is dismissed.

"forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a); or (5) calculate an applicable sentencing range under the Sentencing Guidelines. In its written judgment following the sentencing hearing, the District Court did expressly adopt the findings of the PSR and identify the applicable sentencing range. While this was helpful, the District Court still did not do all that it should have. Where, as here, the Guidelines range exceeds 24 months, the sentencing court has a statutory obligation “at the time of sentencing, [to] state in open court the reasons for its imposition of the particular sentence.” 18 U.S.C. § 3553(c). Moreover, while adopting the findings of the PSR is ordinarily sufficient to satisfy § 3553(c), the findings must be adopted in “open court.”  REDACTED While Buissereth’s appeal waiver did not relieve the District Court of its responsibility to follow the procedural requirements related to the imposition of a sentence, the appeal waiver does preclude this Court from correcting the errors alleged to have occurred below.

Further, the gas receipts showing the total expenses do not corroborate the Langers’ estimated percentages of time Henry used the van and the car for business. See  REDACTED The Langers argue the substantiation requirements of § 274(d) do not apply to local travel expenses. See Palo Alto Town & Country Village, Inc. v. Commissioner, 565 F.2d 1388, 1391 (9th Cir.1977). The Langers’ gas receipts, however, do not show that their claimed expenses are for local travel. Indeed, Patricia and her sister testified Henry drove his car on long-distance trips for the partnership. Nevertheless, if some of the expenses were for local travel, the Langers must still show the local travel expenses were ordinary and necessary business expenses proximately related to the partnership under § 162.

"res judicata to preclude Kenny from pursuing this appeal is based on Kenny’s voluntary dismissal with prejudice of her counterclaim in the original suit seeking court approval of the sale of the RGI stock. Under the doctrine of res judicata, claims asserted in a subsequent suit may be barred by a prior adjudication if three requirements are met: (1) The first suit must have concluded in a final judgment on the merits; (2) The second suit must involve the assertion of claims by persons who were parties or in privity with parties in the first suit; and (3) The claims asserted in the second suit must be based on the same cause of action as the first suit.

"the defendant that the defendant cannot obtain a fair and impartial trial at any place fixed by law for holding court in that district.” Fed. R.Crim.P. 21(a). To succeed on a motion to change venue under Rule 21(a), defendants must show “a reasonable likelihood that prejudicial news prior to trial will prevent a fair trial.” Maldonado-Rivera, 922 F.2d at 966-67. The court finds that defendants have not shown a reasonable likelihood that such publicity has so permeated this district that a fair trial is impossible. Mere knowledge of the crime and the accused is an insufficient basis to transfer venue. See Irvin, 366 U.S. at 722, 81 S.Ct. at 1642 (jurors need not be totally ignorant of the facts and issues);  REDACTED The Supreme Court has found that even pervasive and adverse pretrial publicity “does not inevitably lead to an unfair trial.” Nebraska Press Association, 427 U.S. at 554, 96 S.Ct. at 2800. In addition, transfer to a venue outside New York City would be hardly likely to diminish the level of media coverage. See United States v.

"principal residence, the literal language of § 1322(b)(2) would appear to prohibit the application of § 506. In this situation, consideration should be given inter alia to the following factors: the percentage of the debt that is Under Water, the term of the mortgage, the purpose for which the debt was incurred, and the rate of interest charged. A number of cases consider these and other pertinent factors in determining whether to grant a § 506 valuation in such a case. Generally, in these cases the primary consideration is whether the second mortgage holder is of the type § 1322(b)(2) was intended to protect (i.e. long term, purchase-money mortgagees of residential property, who as a group have not been abusive).

"functions of a job, with or without reasonable accommodation, cannot, as a matter of law, be considered “otherwise qualified” under the ADA. That is the case here. Although plaintiff was given a limited release to seek employment in March of 2006, she concedes that her illness and treatment prevented her from performing the duties as defendant’s store manager during the six months of chemotherapy. On the issue of reasonable accommodation, she admits that at the time of termination she had no idea when, if ever, she would be able to return and that a request for an indefinite leave of absence (regardless which party had the obligation to request it) is not a reasonable accommodation under the ADA.

Although ERISA does not mandate the award of prejudgment interest to prevailing plan participants, district courts have the discretion to award prejudgment interest in accordance with general equitable principles. Coffey v. UNUM Life Ins. Co., 302 F.3d 576, 585 (6th Cir.2002) (citing Ford v. Uniroyal Pension Plan, 154 F.3d 613, 616 (6th Cir.1998)).

If any inmate violates the conditions prescribed by the institution, his work release privileges may be withdrawn.” (emphasis added) At oral argument, the defendants contended that the statute does not control because Mr. Perrote’s transfer was for a reason unrelated to the work/study release program, and the decision to transfer was not because of an infraction of a condition of the educational program. It is clear from the affidavit filed on behalf of the defendants that eligibility for the program depends upon the prisoner’s having a minimum security classification. Thus, the decision to transfer Mr. Perrote to a maximum security institution was effectively a decision to terminate his participation in the program. The defendants rely on  REDACTED  where it was held that a prisoner is not entitled to a due process hearing prior to being labelled a special offender where the effect of such classification is to foreclose the prisoner’s eligibility for rehabilitation programs. In my opinion, Solomon is distinguishable since no statutory protection similar to Wis.Stat. § 56.065(2) was provided by the state. I think it is arguable that the Wisconsin Department of Corrections has not merely extended certain programs to prisoners, but has conditioned the termination of participation in such programs on violations of conditions prescribed by the institution.

Realty Advisory Bd. on Labor Relations, 107 F.3d 979, 982 (2d Cir.1997); Powers v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., 923 F.Supp. 21, 23 (S.D.N.Y. 1996);  REDACTED D. Splitting of Arbitration Costs Finally, Arakawa asserts that the arbitration clause here is not valid because it requires plaintiff and JNG to split the fees and costs of the arbitration. In Gilmer, the U.S. Supreme Court found that federal statutory claims could be subject to preexisting arbitration agreements because “Wo long as the prospective litigant effectively may vindicate [his or her] statutory cause of action in the arbitral forum, the statute will continue to serve both its remedial and deterrent function.” See Gilmer, 500 U.S. at 28, 111 S.Ct. 1647. In light of Gilmer, the U.S. Courts of Appeals for the Tenth, Eleventh, and D.C. Circuits have found that arbitration agreements that require a Title VII plaintiff to pay all or",201338
"view of the law on these issues were correct. IV. Defendant argues that a violation of § 8 does not support the portion of the court’s order enjoining him from voting his shares for the election of directors. The district court had power to do more than enjoin the specific violation found, see, e. g., United States v. Bausch & Lomb Co., 321 U.S. 707, 724, 64 S.Ct. 805, 88 L.Ed. 1024, and we think the relief granted was warranted by the record. This conclusion is supported by the repeated approval of comparable relief in cases arising under § 7. See, e. g., Crane Co. v. Briggs Mfg. Co., 280 F.2d 747, 750 (6th Cir. 1960);  REDACTED Vanadium Corp. of America v. Susquehanna Corporation, 203 F.Supp. 686 (D.Del.1962); Hamilton Watch Co. v. Benrus Watch Co., 206 F.2d 738 (2d Cir. 1953). Finally, defendant objects to the portion of the order directing him to pay plaintiff’s attorney’s fees. This objection is well taken. Plaintiff has not proven any pecuniary injury which would entitle it to a recovery under § 4 of the Clayton Act. That section authorizes the recovery of a reasonable attorney’s fee, but there is no such express authorization in § 16, the section under which this action was brought. We believe this case should be treated in the customary manner; plaintiff should accept the normal burden of compensating its own counsel. Of course, costs, including",779087
"registered either trademarks or business names similar to Lovely Skin’s trademarks cannot overcome the strong presumption of validity and establish a prima facie case that Lovely Skin’s marks had not acquired distinctiveness at the time of their registrations through substantially exclusive use for the five preceding years. See Curtis-Stephens-Embry Co., 199 F.2d at 414 (finding evidence of third party trademarks registrations insufficient to support a finding of invalidity where the registrations “did not show, and there was no effort made to prove, where they had been used (other than at the place of business), whether they were in use after the dates of the registrations or had been discontinued, or how exclusive their use had been”); see also  REDACTED Scarves by Vera, Inc., 544 F.2d at 1173 (finding that evidence of third-party registrations was insufficient to weaken a trademark’s acquired distinctiveness where “[defendant introduced no evidence that these trademarks were actually used by third parties, that they were well promoted or that they were recognized by consumers”). In determining that Ishtar had satisfied its initial burden, the district court also relied on the testimonies of attorneys Green and Carnaby and Dr. Schlessinger. However, with this evidence, Ishtar only established that: (1) Green did not perform and currently is unaware of any investigation performed by Carnaby into whether Lovely Skin’s use of its trademarks",102664
"Plaintiffs claim in Count II essentially alleges violations of 42 U.S.C. § 12132, which generally prohibits a public entity from excluding a qualified individual with a disability from services, programs, or activities of the public entity. See also 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(a) (same). 25. To establish a violation of Title II, plaintiff must show: (1) that he is a qualified individual with a disability; (2) that he was either excluded from participation in or denied the benefits of some public entity’s services, programs, or activities, or was otherwise discriminated against by the public entity; and (3) that such exclusion, denial of benefits, or discrimination was by reason of the plaintiffs disability.  REDACTED cf. Pushkin v. Regents of University of Colorado, 658 F.2d 1372, 1385 (10th Cir.1980) (setting forth similar criteria for § 504 claims).

"He had never spoken to Joe Levy nor read Levy’s note to Luehrs. What he knew about the Brown Bag came from Morello’s memorandum. But the memorandum gives the clear impression that Levy’s concern was resolved, and that the salesmen in the area desired to continue selling to Belk-Avery. The Court therefore concludes that when Rosenberg ordered a cessation of dealing with BelkAvery, the opening of the Brown Bag and the actions of Joe Levy had no causal connection with that decision.

"Section 9 factor, the administration of justice is aided, rather than harmed, by reprosecution, as it prevents the defendant from escaping liability for his alleged robbery on a technicality. Ultimately, the Court must apply the language of Section 9 and the IAD’s stated purpose, which in this case called for dismissal of the first indictment without prejudice. Nothing, has changed since the date of the Original Order to merit revisiting that determination. 3.2 Vindictive Prosecution The Court next addresses the vindictive prosecution motion. Erazo-Santa seeks a presumption of vindictiveness, recognized in certain circumstances, which the government would then need to overcome. See United States v. Ribota, 792 F.3d 837, 840 (7th Cir. 2015). Erazo-Santa asserts that Magistrate Joseph erroneously applied  REDACTED  and United States v. Spears, 159 F.3d 1081 (7th Cir. 1998), on this issue.

"periodic, nonreversionary contributions). Therefore, the Court will review the Claim’s Committee’s decision using and arbitrary and capricious standard. Before applying the arbitrary and capricious standard to the facts, it is necessary to dispose of a preliminary issue related to the standard of review. Boin urges the Court to use the rule of contra proferentem, meaning that if an ambiguity exists and there are two plausible interpretations, the terms should be construed against the drafter. See Florence Nightingale Nursing Service, Inc. v. Blue Cross/ Blue Shield of Alabama, 41 F.3d 1476, 1481 (11th Cir.1995). Although the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals has held that the rule of contra proferentem is generally applicable to ERISA plan interpretation cases,  REDACTED  its use is practically limited to cases in which a heightened arbitrary and capricious standard is used. See Vann, 978 F.Supp. at 1042-43; see also Cagle v. Bruner, 112 F.3d 1510, 1519 (11th Cir.1997). As the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals explained, “the arbitrary and capricious standard of review would have little meaning if ambiguous language in an ERISA plan were construed against the [Plan].” Cagle, 112 F.3d at 1519.

"as a matter of law. Initially, of course, the court must always determine whether the defendant has presented enough evidence to put his sanity in question. See United States v. Holt, 5 Cir. 1971, 450 F.2d 868. The court must also determine whether the Government’s evidence is sufficient to make an issue for the jury on the defense of insanity and thus avoid a directed verdict of acquittal. Finally, in the event of a guilty verdict, the court must decide whether the Government’s evidence is sufficient to support the conclusion of the trier of facts as to the defendant’s sanity at the time of the offense. United States v. Collier, 5 Cir. 1972, 453 F.2d 1173, 1176-1177;  REDACTED d 858, 885, cert. denied, 1971, 404 U.S. 828, 92 S.Ct. 63, 30 L.Ed.2d 56; Blake v. United States, supra, 407 F.2d at 911. This court has never precisely defined the quantum of evidence necessary to constitute sufficiency for each of these determinations, though the level obviously rises from the first to the third. Indeed exact quantification, even if possible, would probably be undesirable. Instead, through the painful process of case-by-case adjudication we have educed a set of general principles to guide both the trial court in exercising its role of weighing the evidence as a matter of law and the appellate court in reviewing that exercise. Foremost among these principles is the realization that “each [case] must be decided upon its own facts with",82299

While the extent disclosure requirements may vary depending on the exact nature of the records (as will shortly be seen), an overarching and universal precondition to disclosing protected information is satisfaction of one of these three tests. Here, however, the Government argues neither the existence of a medical emergency (§ 290dd-2(b)(2)(A)) nor the information is sought to assist in auditing the [Hospital’s] program (§ 290dd-2(b)(2)(C)); instead it focuses on the third circumstance for disclosure and seeks to establish the existence of “good cause” to support a court order releasing the data. As the party seeking disclosure of the records held by [the Hospital], the Government bears the burden of establishing “good cause.” Cresta, 825 F.2d at 552;  REDACTED Pursuant to authority granted in § 290dd-2d(g), the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Service promulgated regulations implementing the statutory disclosure provisions. See 42 C.F.R. §§ 2.1-2.67 (1994). Section 2.66 of the rules, which the Government argues is the applicable standard, dictates “[procedures and criteria for orders authorizing disclosure and use of records to investigate or prosecute a program or the person holding the records.” Id. § 2.66.

"""A. 609, was, however, a ease in substance like that at bar, because there the plaintiff alleged that it"""" had acquired the entire output of sheet aluminum suitable for washboards. It necessarily fol lowed that the plaintiff had a practical monopoly of this metal for the articles in question, and from this it was a fair inference that any customer of the defendant, who was deceived into buying as an aluminum washboard one which was not such, was a presumptive customer of the plaintiff, who had therefore lost a bargain. This was held, however, not to constitute a private wrong, and so the bill was dismissed. Furthermore, we do not agree with the plaintiff that cases like  REDACTED on in Royal Baking Powder Co. v. Federal Trade Commission, 281 F. 744, are in his favor. These arose under the Federal Trade Commission Act (Comp. St. §§ 8836a-8836k) where it is only necessary to show that the public interest has been affected. The defendant’s customers in such eases-had an undoubted grievance, and this was thought to be enough to justify the intervention of the Federal Trade Commission.

"state law should control the question of how a state welfare agency perfects its rights in federal funds. (See Vazquez III, p. 134 and ftnt. 4.) SCWD clearly complied with the federally mandated provisions of 42 U.S.C. § 1383(g)(4) and 20 C.F.R. § 416.1910. Secondly, because of 42 U.S.C. § 407, there are no competing creditors that need to be notified of SCWD’s security interest in the SSI benefits and therefore the UCC’s concept of perfection by notice is not applicable to the transaction in question. Thirdly, the provisions of 42 U.S.C. § 407 defeats the “strong arm” provisions of 11 U.S.C. § 544, which is the primary means of avoiding equitable liens by the bankruptcy trustee. (See, e.g.,  REDACTED Finally, in weighing the policy of the Bankruptcy Code in providing a “fresh start” for debtors against the conflicting policies of the IAR program in efficiently utilizing limited welfare funds, providing much-needed assistance to SSI recipients during the gap period and, at the same time, limiting “double dipping,” the scales are definitely weighted against the Bankruptcy Code policy. While this Court agrees with the Vazquez III court that federal law determines the nature of the transaction between the parties and that the state welfare agencies are entitled to retain the appropriate amount of the SSI benefits received from the SSA, it does not agree with the conclusion of that court that no debt existed between the debtors and the state welfare agencies",243711

Nevertheless, the Court considers all of this information to be competent for the instant purpose of considering the three Defendants’ respective motions. U.S. v.

"Court denied this motion. The Court held that the interests of justice did not necessitate appointing counsel for the petitioner: The Court notes that the Petitioner, with the assistance of counsel, has already filed his petition and a reply to the Government’s opposition. As the case is fully briefed and merely awaiting decision, there is no need to appoint counsel at this time. Nunez v. U.S., 892 F.Supp. 528, 531-32 (S.D.N.Y.1995). Moreover, the Petitioner has failed to submit any evidence of the financial means available to him to pay for private counsel, and the extensive argument and citation in his pro se application for bail suggest that he is capable of presenting his claims effectively without the assistance of an attorney.

But where an indictment charges a conspiracy to commit offenses against the United States, one of which is not an offense, the latter may be regarded as surplusage and ignored, and this is not a forbidden amendment of the indictment. Ford v. United States, 273 U.S. 593, 47 S.Ct. 531, 71 L.Ed. 793; Bailey v. United States, 5 Cir., 1925, 5 F.2d 437. Mere surplusage or unnecessary allegations will not vitiate an indictment which contains sufficient matter to charge a crime. If the indictment can be supported without them, they will be regarded as surplusage.

If there is any possibility that plaintiff could establish personal jurisdiction over CFMI, S.A. in state court, this case is not cognizable in federal court. Thus, the argument tracks traditional fraudulent joinder doctrine. Plaintiff’s argument is compelling. Were the Court to address his motion first, the Court’s inquiry would be as plaintiff wishes.

McConnell was recently followed by another panel of this court in a case involving similar facts. See In re Hawaii Corp., 694 F.2d 179, 181 (9th Cir.1982). The reasoning embodied in McConnell has been applied in other circuits. See In re Trimble Co., 339 F.2d 838, 841-43 (3d Cir.1964); Mountain State Steel Foundries, Inc. v.

The Fifth Circuit in Robinson explained the policy behind the doctrine: A transaction by which a corporation acquires its own stock from a stockholder for a sum of money is not really a sale. The corporation does not acquire anything of value equivalent to the depletion of its assets, if the stock is held in the treasury, as in this case. It is simply a method of distributing a proportion of the assets to the stockholder.

Conclusions of Law Before a preliminary injunction may be granted, four prerequisites must be satisfied by the moving party. The movant must establish: (1) a showing that the movant will suffer irreparable injury unless the injunction issues; (2) proof that the threatened injury outweighs whatever damage the proposed injunction may cause the opposing party; (3) a showing that the injunction, if issued, would not be adverse to the public interest; and (4) a substantial likelihood that the movant will eventually prevail on the merits.  REDACTED City of Chanute v. Kansas Gas & Electric Co., 754 F.2d 310, 312 (10th Cir.1985). Where the first three requirements for a preliminary injunction are satisfied, the Tenth Circuit has lessened the moving party’s burden of proof on the fourth requirement.

"respect to a stay of an act against property, if— (A) the debtor does not have an equity in such property; and (B) such property is not necessary to an effective reorganization. The bankruptcy court annulled the automatic stay solely on the basis that the sellers’ “interest in and to the subject real estate lacks adequate protection.” The bankruptcy court failed to explain the legal or factual basis for this conclusion. It is true that the bankruptcy court found that the debtors and the estate did not have any “realizable equity” in the Upland residence. The fact that the debtor has no equity in the estate is not sufficient, standing alone, to grant relief from the automatic stay under section 362(d)(1).  REDACTED The sellers argue that since the first trust deed to Weyerhauser ($66,700) and the second trust deed to AKOP ($123,278) total more than $189,000, which exceeds the value of the residence ($105,000), their interest ($17,960.06) lacked adequate protection. While the term “adequate protection” is not defined in the Code, 11 U.S.C. § 361 sets forth three non-exclusive examples of what may constitute adequate protection: 1) periodic cash payments equivalent to decrease in value, 2) an additional or replacement lien on other property, or 3) other relief that provides the indubitable equivalent.

"criminal history from a Category III to a Category VI which exposed him to a sentence between 77 and 96 months rather than a range of 41 to 51 months. II. Discussion A. Possession Standard Lane first contends that the district court misunderstood the legal standard of possession and as a result, wrongly instructed the jury and prevented Lane from presenting a viable trial theory. To prove that Lane was a felon in possession of a firearm, the government was required to show that Lane (1) had been convicted of a crime punishable by a prison term exceeding one year and (2) knowingly possessed a firearm (3) that traveled in or affected interstate commerce. See 18 U.S.C. §§ 922(g)(1), 924(a)(2);  REDACTED We review Lane’s legal challenge de novo. See United States v. Stott, 245 F.3d 890, 904 (7th Cir.2001). At trial, the government agreed to focus only on the incidents at the Twin Oaks Tavern and not the gun’s presence in Lane’s garage. We likewise limit our inquiry. At trial, the judge held that momentarily handling a gun satisfied the legal definition of “possession” as a matter of law. While possession can be actual or constructive, see United States v. Kitchen, 57 F.3d 516, 520 (7th Cir.1995), the government has pressed the actual possession theory. Actual possession occurs when a defendant “knowingly has direct physical control over a thing at a given time.” United States v. Walls, 225 F.3d 858, 864",746877

United States, 343 F.2d 139, 142 (5th Cir.1965); see also  REDACTED The indictment charged two overt acts occurring within the statute of limitations. While at the conception of the conspiracy James Edward Walls was not a government agent or informant, it is undisputed that he became a government informant prior to performing the two overt acts, which occurred within the statute of limitations and were also alleged in the indictment. The issue presented for the court’s decision is whether these acts maybe imputed to defendant Reuben Walls. The essential elements of a conspiracy include “an agreement between two or more persons to combine efforts for an illegal purpose and an overt act by one of the members in furtherance of the agreement.”",550051

Downs, 784 F.3d 1180, 1182 (7th Cir. 2015); United States v. Sanford, 806 F.3d 954, 967 (7th Cir. 2015). We have not, however, been as clear as we might be on what that resentencing must entail. At the time of Mobley’s second sentencing, for example, we had only just issued United States v. Kappes, 782 F.3d 828 (7th Cir. 2015), where we discussed Thompson at length. The present case offers another opportunity to clarify what is necessary, and what is desirable. It presents three separate questions: first, whether a remand “in light of Thompson” is a full remand or a remand limited to issues relating to supervised release; second, if it is a full remand, what",160544

Under the discretionary sentencing system established by United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), district courts retain a duty to consider the Sentencing Guidelines, along with the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a). United States v. Mares, 402 F.3d 511, 518-19 (5th Cir.2005). This court reviews the sentence imposed for reasonableness in light of those factors. Id. at 519.

Pursuant to Gall, this court must first determine whether the district court committed any procedural errors, “such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the § 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence — including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.” Gall, 128 S.Ct. at 597.

"the Litman trial transcript, we note that Judge Cohill at no time stated or concluded that either Dr. Rosenbloom’s testimony or Mrs. Noll’s testimony was perjured. In reviewing the trial transcript of this case, we find absolutely no evidence of a deliberate attempt by the United States to present perjured testimony or unreliable documentary evidence. On the contrary, a review of the testimony of both Dr. Rosenbloom and Mrs. Noll indicates not a hint of false or perjured testimony. After lengthy and thorough research, this court has found only one case where a witness’s credibility was challenged subsequent to his testimony at a trial and said challenge to the witness’s credibility resulted in the granting of a new trial. See  REDACTED However, it must be noted that in Mesarosh no motion for new trial under Rule 33, Fed.R.Crim.P., was filed by counsel for the defendant. The Supreme Court of the United States in Mesarosh, supra, granted a motion for new trial in an instance where the Solicitor General of the United States moved that the case be remanded to the district court for determination as to the credibility of the testimony of a key government witness at trial.

An acknowledgment by the district court that it has considered the defendant’s arguments and the factors in § 3553(a) is sufficient. Id. The weight given to any specific § 3553(a) factor is committed to the sound discretion of the district court. United States v.

A court can abuse its discretion when it (1) fails to consider relevant factors that were due significant weight, (2) gives an improper or irrelevant factor significant weight, or (3) commits a clear error of judgment by balancing the proper factors unreasonably.  REDACTED While unjustified reliance on a single § 3553(a) factor may be a symptom of an unreasonable sentence, such a sentence is not necessarily unreasonable. United States v. Williams, 526 F.3d 1312, 1322 (11th Cir.2008). Roberson’s 96-month sentence is reasonable. The district court did not make any procedural errors in its explanation of its reasoning in imposing an upward variance above the guideline sentence. Further, Roberson does not meet his burden of proof in showing that the district court abused its discretion when weighing the factors contained within 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a).

But the only cite provided for this argument is a Seventh Circuit case. See Gusman v. Unisys Corp., 986 F.2d 1146 (7th Cir.1993). In Gusman, Judge Easterbrook asserted that Blum v. Stenson does not establish a principle of averaging. Id. at 1149. However, even if Gusman were binding precedent, the district court in this case did not simply average the rates for all attorneys in the Sacramento area. 'Rather, the district court considered Wallace’s expertise and experience and applied the prevailing rate for.similarly qualified local counsel. This approach is well-established in our circuit. See  REDACTED In short, we agree that $200 per hour is the appropriate prevailing rate in the Sacramento area. III. Compensation for Delayed Payment Even though we refuse to award additional attorney’s fees over the prevailing rate in the relevant community, Barjon and Duran still request compensation for the Secretary’s delay in payment of undisputed fees. Wallace argues that the right to fees accrued when her clients became prevailing parties-April 18,1994 in Barjon’s case and August 17,1994 in Duran’s case.

On December 8, 1997, this Court entered a Memorandum of Decision concluding that she is entitled to judgment in the amount of $56,000. Pending before this Court is the plaintiffs motion for an award of prejudgment interest from and after November 30, 1992, plus reasonable attorneys’ fees of $23,345. A.

The original public meaning of the Second Amendment included individuals eighteen to twenty: the same scenario at issue here.

We have enough historical evidence to decide that 18- to 20-year olds can claim “core” Second Amendment protection.

United States v. South Carolina, 840 F.Supp.2d at 924. Courts reviewing the constitutionality of the Arizona and Georgia immigration statutes reached similar conclusions. See  REDACTED GLAHR v. Deal, 793 F.Supp.2d 1317, 1330-33 (N.D.Ga.2011). But see United States v. Alabama, 813 F.Supp.2d 1282, 1318-29 (N.D.Ala.2011). The Supreme Court in the Arizona decision concluded otherwise. In doing so, the Court observed that the requesting of immigration status information by state and local officials from the federal government was explicitly authorized under federal law and “[i]ndeed, [Congress] has encouraged the sharing of information about possible immigration violations.” Arizona v. United States, 132 S.Ct. at 2508. Thus, the Supreme Court concluded that the “federal scheme ... leaves room for a policy requiring state officials to contact ICE as a routine matter.” Id.

"to any offense. The petitioners were found guilty on all charges, and, as was required by statute, sentenced to death. The Supreme Court of North Carolina affirmed. 287 N. C. 578, 215 S. E. 2d 607 (1975). We granted certiorari, 423 U. S. 1082 (1976), to consider whether the imposition of the death penalties in this case comports 'with the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. II The petitioners argue that the imposition of the death penalty under any circumstances is cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. We reject this argument for the reasons stated today in Gregg v. Georgia, ante, at 168-187. III At the time of this Court’s decision in  REDACTED  North Carolina law provided that in cases of first-degree murder, the jury in its unbridled discretion could choose whether the convicted defendant should be sentenced to death or to life imprisonment. After the Furman decision the Supreme Court of North Carolina in State v. Waddell, 282 N. C. 431; 194 S. E. 2d 19 (1973), held unconstitutional the provision of the death penalty statute that gave the jury the option of returning a verdict of guilty without cap ital punishment, but held further that this provision was severable so that the statute survived as a mandatory death penalty law. The North Carolina General Assembly in 1974 followed the court’s lead and enacted a new statute that was essentially unchanged from the",297309
"including any order of restitution, ... on any ground whatever, in exchange for the concessions made by the United States in this plea agreement.” The exception is inapplicable because the prison sentence was less than the maximum authorized by the statutes under which Bownes was convicted and there is no ceiling on restitution. But he argues that his waiver was not knowing and intelligent because he had no reason to anticipate the ruling in Booker. Not only did the agreement predate the Supreme Court’s decision; it preceded our decision in Booker, which the Supreme Court affirmed. Disputes over plea agreements are usefully viewed through the lens of contract law. E.g., United States v. Randle, 324 F.3d 550, 557-58 (7th Cir.2003);  REDACTED United States v. Williams, 184 F.3d 666, 670-71 (7th Cir.1999); United States v. Brunetti, 376 F.3d 93, 95-96 (2d Cir.2004) (per curiam); United States v. Sar-Avi, 255 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (9th Cir.2001). A plea agreement is a type of contract, and the principles of contract law are highly developed, though as we shall note shortly their application to plea agreements must be tempered by recognition of limits that the Constitution places on the criminal process, limits that have no direct counterparts in the sphere of private contracting. In a contract (and equally in a plea agreement) one binds oneself to do something that someone else wants, in exchange for some benefit to oneself. By binding oneself one assumes the risk",571459
"support for a disfavored educational approach (removing or disciplining. disruptive kids) may be useful to a school in determining how a teacher runs her classroom. When a communication is simultaneously protected speech (as a call to the public to change the way the schools run) and a sound reason for an employer to act (when it reveals information relevant to performance on the job), it is essential to determine how the speech has been taken into account. Did the school district penalize an expression of views about how the schools ought to run (forbidden) or consider an expression that revealed how the teacher manages or wants to manage her own class (permitted)? One clue, here as in  REDACTED  is to whom the statement was made. Wales did not issue a public call for change; she complained to her immediate supervisor (and to her supervisor’s supervisor) about how the conditions in her classroom affected her. Although the first amendment is not limited to speech that is broadcast to the world, see Givhan v.

The only issue, as stated by the Court, was: “ * * * -whether what was done amounts to an unfair labor practice within section 8(1) of the act. This depends on whether or not the ‘wild cat’ strike, in which the discharged employees were engaged, falls within the protection of section 7 of the act.

For example, courts have held that a vehicle is subject to forfeiture if it was used to transport confederates to a prearranged meeting where a sale is merely discussed,  REDACTED d at 426; or if it is used in “laying the groundwork” for the sale of contraband, United States v. One 1979 Mercury Cougar XR-7, 666 F.2d 228, 230 (5th Cir.1982); or if it is used as a lookout vehicle during the actual transaction, United States v.

One 1972 Datsun, 378 F.Supp. 1200, 1202 (D.N.H.1974). Accordingly, it seems clear that if the BMW in this case was used for surveillance, as the government contends, then an order of forfeiture would be required. To succeed in its contention under the federal forfeiture statutes, the government need only show that it had probable cause to believe that the BMW was used as a lookout vehicle during the September 29, 1980 drug transaction. Once probable cause has been shown, the burden of proof shifts to the claimant to rebut the probable cause showing and to demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that the vehicle was not used as the government asserted. 19 U.S.C. § 1615; United States v.

Back pay awards are a form of restitution, an equitable remedy. Detroit Edison, supra, 515 F.2d at 308; contra, Rogers v. Exxon Research & Engineering Co., supra, at 839 n. 6. .

"indictment of Mr. Litman. The mere fact that United States Attorney Cindrich had not made a final decision as to whether an indictment should or should not be sought is not dispositive of whether or not finally seeking the indictment was justified. The allegations that the Government failed to present exculpatory evidence to the grand jury and failed to point out discrepancies in its case must be considered in greater detail. As a general proposition, the prosecution is not obligated to search for and present exculpatory evidence to a grand jury. United States v.

Nor is the prosecution obligated to present evidence to the grand jury which would negate culpability, which would bear on the credibility of the witnesses, or which would otherwise be favorable to the accused.

The prosecution violates Brady where it suppresses evidence that is favorable to the defendant and material to the outcome of the case. Evidence is deemed “suppressed” if the prosecution actually knows about it but does not disclose it, but evidence is also deemed “suppressed” if the prosecution constructively knows about it — for example, if a member of the wider “prosecution team,” including non-lawyer investigators, knows about it — but does not disclose it. See  REDACTED Evidence is “material” when there is a reasonable probability that, if it had been disclosed before trial, the defendant would have been acquitted. Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U.S. 419, 432-42, 115 S.Ct. 1555, 131 L.Ed.2d 490 (1995). Therefore, by definition, evidence that is merely cumulative of evidence that was disclosed cannot be material because defense counsel already had it (or had access to it). See United States v. Boone, 279 F.3d 163, 191 (3d Cir.2002); United States v. Hill, 976 F.2d 132, 138 (3d Cir.1992).

In the decision, the ALJ adequately articulated why he gave each opinion the weight he did, entitling his decision, in this respect, to our deference. See  REDACTED Starting with Dr. Gopala, the ALJ appropriately questioned the doctor's conclusion-that Winsted had a painful range of motion that made him incapable of engaging in """"low-stress"""" work-in light of other record evidence.

Minneapolis Star, 460 U.S. at 580, 103 S.Ct. at 1369. However, this reading of Grosjean does not save the statute at issue. Even if we assume no censorial motive on the part of the legislature , the statute fails to meet constitutional muster. Although general economic regulation of the press is permissible, differential taxation based on content is valid only if the state can show that the regulation serves a compelling state interest and is narrowly tailored to serve that interest.  REDACTED Minneapolis Star, 460 U.S. at 591-92, 103 S.Ct. at 1375-76. This standard surely applies to this case where the state goes beyond burdening the press through a taxation scheme, as was the case in the abovecited cases, and directly prohibits the periodical from utilizing its only means of gathering revenue. The second evil of singling out a particular publication is also present in that the prohibition is based on the qualifications of the speaker.

"the Ross court states: “The closer the question of dismissal, the less likely it may be appropriate to award counsel fees.... Similarly, if the petitioners could demonstrate that their involuntary petition was dismissed due to improper conduct of the alleged debtor, then fees may not be awarded.” Id. (citations omitted). This Court finds these two factors — the merits of the involuntary petition, and the role of any improper conduct on the part of the alleged debtor — are definitive issues to be considered within the § 303(i)(l) totality of the circumstances analysis herein. Additionally, a court should consider the reasonableness of the actions taken by the petitioning creditors, as well as the motivation and objectives behind filing the petition.  REDACTED CONCLUSION There were approximately twelve days of trial in this case, four on the issue of dismissal and eight on the issue of bad faith. This Court will not restate the findings affirmed in its § 303(i) Opinion here, but relies on those findings to support its conclusion. Applying the adopted standard to this case, this Court concludes there is sufficient evidence before it to deny attorney’s fees and costs to the involuntary Debtor.

The board is free to issue a new order, although presumably it would have taken action to correct any deficiencies found in the files of other registrants.

"this setting, given the importance of “costs” to the Rule, it is very unlikely that this omission was mere oversight; on the contrary, the most reasonable inference is that the term “costs” in Rule 68 was intended to refer to all costs properly awardable under the relevant substantive statute or other authority. In other words, all costs properly awardable in an action are to be considered within the scope of Rule 68 “costs.” Thus, absent congressional expressions to the contrary, where the underlying statute defines “costs” to include attorney’s fees, we are satisfied such fees are to be included as costs for purposes of Rule 68. See, e. g., Fulps v. Springfield, Tenn., 715 F. 2d 1088, 1091-1095 (CA6 1983);  REDACTED Scheriff v. Beck, 452 F. Supp. 1254, 1259-1260 (Colo. 1978). See also Delta Air Lines, Inc. v. August, 450 U.

P., which states, “A plain error that affects substantial rights may be considered even though it was not brought to the court’s attention.” Fed. R. Crim. P. 52(b). An appellant challenging a forfeited error therefore must show that (1) there was an error; (2) the error was “plain—that is to say, clear or obvious”; and (3) the error affected the defendant’s substantial rights, which ordinarily means a reasonable probability that the error af fected the outcome.

We agree with those courts which have held that a governmental agency violates the automatic stay when it “holds” or “freezes” payments the debtor is otherwise entitled to receive.

"a question of law for the court to decide by looking at the contract in light of the circumstances existing at the time the contract was entered into.” Reilly v. Rangers Management, Inc., 727 S.W.2d 527, 529 (Tex.1987). If [an] agreement is worded so that this Court can ascertain a certain or definite meaning, it is not ambiguous. If the agreement, however, is reasonably susceptible to more than one interpretation, it is ambiguous. A contract is not ambiguous merely because the parties disagree upon the correct interpretation or upon whether it is reasonably open to just one interpretation. If the agreement is ambiguous, summary judgment is improper because interpretation of the agreement is a fact question for the jury-  REDACTED Applying that rule, we conclude that the “direct efforts” clause of the December 24, 1996 contract is not ambiguous in any material respect. The clause provides that Jordan will be paid a fee “should [a] [Jordan] contact make a direct equity investment in [Kimmons] through the direct efforts of [Jordan] with no broker, attorney, finder, financial consultant or other person or entity due any fees from [Kimmons] arising from the transaction.” This provision of the December 1996 contract is not ambiguous in any sense relevant to this case and thus does not, without more, raise a genuine dispute as to a material issue of fact. Jordan did not introduce any evidence from which it reasonably could be found or inferred",782862
"(6th Cir.1998) (under ERISA a person is a fiduciary only with respect to those aspects of plan over which he or she exercises authority or control). To that end, courts have distinguished employer actions that constitute “managing” or “administering” a plan from those actions that merely constitute “business decisions” which have an effect on an ERISA plan; the managing or administering the plan are deemed “fiduciary acts” while business decisions are not. See Sengpiel v. B.F. Goodrich Co., 156 F.3d 660, 665 (6th Cir.1998). When an insurance company administers claims for employee welfare benefit plans and has authority to grant or deny claims, the insurance company is a “fiduciary” for ERISA purposes. See  REDACTED Indeed, Premier was named as the plan administrator; however, Defendant is a fiduciary for purposes of ERISA inasmuch as it had a role in administering the plan because it had authority to accept or reject claims for losses under the group insurance policy as evidenced by the rejection letter that it sent to Plaintiff in response to her attorney’s letter. Consequently, the district court incorrectly determined that Defendant was not a fiduciary for purposes of ERISA. 2.

And finally, the type of relief requested by Plaintiff should be considered. Courts refuse to defer jurisdiction if the plaintiff is seeking damages for injury to property or person, as this is the type of relief courts routinely consider; however, if injunctive relief is called for, requiring scientific or technical expertise, the doctrine is more readily applicable.

"for instance, we upheld a bank robbery conviction where the evidence demonstrated that a defendant entered a bank, kept his hand in his pocket, and told the teller to hand over the money and not to sound the alarm. See Amos, 566 F.2d at 901. Similarly, we upheld a conviction where the defendant handed the teller a note stating “this is a holdup” and placed his hand in his pocket in such a way that the teller assumed he had a gun. See United States v. Harris, 530 F.2d 576, 579 (4th Cir.1976). As these cases demonstrate, the evidence is sufficient to sustain a conviction on the intimidation element if the defendant’s conduct was reasonably calculated to produce fear. See  REDACTED We think it clear, and Walker does not contend otherwise, that the bank teller’s testimony in the instant case was sufficient to sustain a conviction for bank robbery. She testified that Walker approached with his hand in his pocket and told her that this was a robbery, that he had a gun and she should not give him any bait money or pull an alarm. Accordingly, Walker would have been entitled to a jury instruction on the lesser-ineluded offense of bank larceny only if some other evidence of record placed the intimidation element sufficiently in dispute such that the evidence was sharply conflicting or that the conclusion as to the lesser offense fairly could be inferred.

"tax assessments, and (3) divorce. Plaintiffs allege that provisions in the first category “require lists of persons who are qualified voters in Virginia to be maintained on a racially segregated basis.” The second category is averred to “provide for the maintenance on a racially segregated basis of public records pertaining to property ownership and taxation”. The divorce statute in suit directs that every decree of divorce must recite the race of the spouses. Besides asking for a declaration of the invalidity of these statutory and constitutional provisions, plaintiffs also “seek an injunction restraining the various governmental officials named as defendants from enforcing, executing or administering their provisions.” The “separate but equal” racial doctrine was condemned a decade ago in  REDACTED Subsequent decisional law has made it axiomatic that no State can directly dictate or casually promote a distinction in the treatment of persons solely on the basis of their color. To be within the condemnation, the governmental action need not effectuate segregation of facilities directly. Cf. Anderson v. Martin, 375 U.S. 399, 402, 84 S.Ct. 454, 11 L.Ed. 430 (1964).

We find no other evidence sufficient to sustain a finding that it was a part of the conspiracy that truck No. 59 was to be robbed. Under these circumstances, it would be quite improper to sustain the conviction of Tharp on the theory that he did conspire with Lubin to rob truck No. 59, when we must find that there is no evidence sufficient to sustain a conviction of Lubin for conspiring with Tharp to rob that truck.

Indeed, we can find proof of this trend in the lobby of our own Foley Square courthouse, which is decorated in December with a Christmas tree, numerous poinsettia plants, and a menorah. The DOE policy does not permit the menorah or the star and crescent ever to be used in school holiday displays in isolation, thereby avoiding the problem prompting this court to invalidate a menorah display in Kaplan v.

Appellant contends the military judge abandoned his impartial role and that the question of the military judge resulted in a “comparison of appellant to Saddam Hussein, one of the most hated and vilified leaders (often compared to Adolph Hitler) before the members.” He further contends that the gravity of the error is demonstrated by the adjudged sentence to confinement for forty years.

"a lack of guilty knowledge and the evidence supports an inference of deliberate indifference. Delgado, 668 F.3d at 227. The thrust of Main’s defense was that he did not know about the criminal activity. That defense was rebutted with evidence showing (1) Main was actually aware of, let alone had reason to suspect, the health care fraud, United States v. Lara-Velasquez, 919 F.2d 946, 952 (5th Cir. 1990) (explaining that evidence giving rise to an inference of actual knowledge also gives rise to an inference of subjective awareness), and (2) Main did not follow up with Sanjar or Sajadi after a patient complained to him about a tardy kickback. This permitted the court to give the deliberate ignorance instruction. See  REDACTED C. Main next objects to the district court’s refusal to instruct on good faith. Failure to instruct on good faith is not fatal when the jury is given a detailed instruction on specific intent and the defendant has the opportunity to argue good faith to the jury. United States v. Storm, 36 F.3d 1289, 1294-95 (5th Cir. 1994). Both conditions exist here. The court told the jury that the defendants must have acted “with bad purpose either to disobey or disregard the law.” And Main argued good faith during closing, asserting he merely performed his duties as a physician’s assistant and provided treatment to the patients.

"December 11, the Collector of Internal Revenue seized Brokol’s assets under five warrants for distraint totalling $5,742.25. By stipulation the Collector was permitted to sell the assets, retaining the sum of $5,742.25, the amount due under the warrants, plus costs of the sale; the surplus was to be administered in accordance with the order of the Bankruptcy Court. The proceeds of the sale amounted to $7,100. The Referee entered an order on April 17, 1952, directing the Collector to turn over the surplus funds to the Trustee to be administered under the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C.A. § 107.

On appeal this determination was vacated, 3 Cir., 1955, 221 F.2d 640, 642, not on the issue of the sufficiency of the levy, but on the single ground that a Court of Bankruptcy did not have jurisdiction to decide the question as to whether the Government’s omission to follow strictly the statutory procedure is fatal to its attempt to retain the entire proceeds of the sale.

Although he found Uwase’s request for asylum plausible and reasonable based on evidence of the country conditions in Rwanda, he did not find Uwase’s testimony internally consistent or persuasive. The IJ concluded that she did not meet her burden of proving she was subjected to past persecution; specifically, he found that she did not establish that she is of mixed Hutu-Tutsi tribal heritage. Uwase appealed. The BIA affirmed the IJ’s determination without opinion under its streamlining procedure. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(a)(7) (formerly 8 C.F.R. § 3.1(a)(7)). Having appropriately exhausted her administrative remedies, Uwase now seeks review from this Court. II. Analysis In streamlined cases, the IJ’s decision becomes that of the BIA for purposes of judicial review.  REDACTED We apply the substantial evidence standard when reviewing immigration court decisions denying petitions for asylum and requests to withhold deportation. Id. at 967. The BIA’s decision must be affirmed if it is supported by “reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.” Id. (quotations omitted). Here, the bulk of the evidence consists of Uwase’s testimony, much of which the IJ found to be incredible and uncorroborated. Since it is Uwase’s burden to demonstrate she qualifies for asylum, her failure to convince the IJ of the truth of her claim doomed her case. See Krouchevski v.

Both parties have filed briefs, on the jurisdictional questions involved, and a further hearing of the motion is neither necessary nor desirable. It is clear that, if this appeal is from an order in a proceeding in bankruptcy, this court acquired no jurisdiction over the matter by the allowance of an appeal by the District Court. This was decided by this court in Standard Sanitary Mfg. Co. v. Momsen-Dunnegan-Ryan Co., 51 F.(2d) 684, in conformity with the decisions of other Circuit Courts of Appeal.  REDACTED Broders v.

Lightfoot, 364 U.S. 339, 81 S.Ct. 125, 5 L.Ed.2d 110 (1960).

In this instance, Ohio has not committed any final authority to voters in the township concerned. Such final authority has plainly been vested in the Board of County Commissioners. As we will see below, two alternative methods of bringing an annexation issue before that body may be employed. The vote accorded by Ohio to township voters would simply have the function of putting the issue before that Board.

"of possession of a firearm after having been convicted of a crime punishable by more than one year of imprisonment, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g) (2000). The district court sentenced Bonds to 188 months of imprisonment. We affirm. Bonds first asserts that he received ineffective assistance of counsel because counsel was unaware of the superseding indictment that included reference to 18 U.S.C.A. § 924(e) (West 2000 & Supp. 2008). Claims of ineffective assistance of counsel are generally not cognizable on direct appeal. See United States v. King, 119 F.3d 290, 295 (4th Cir.1997). Rather, to allow for adequate development of the record, a defendant must bring his claim in a 28 U.S.C. § 2255 (2000) motion. See id.;  REDACTED An exception exists when the record conclusively establishes ineffective assistance. United States v. Richardson, 195 F.3d 192, 198 (4th Cir.1999); King, 119 F.3d at 295. Our review of the record leads us to conclude that it does not conclusively show that counsel was ineffective. A sentencing enhancement based on the defendant’s prior convictions is not a part of the charge, and need not be included in the indictment. United States v. Thompson, 421 F.3d 278, 280-84 (4th Cir.2005). Thus, counsel’s lack of knowledge of Bonds’ potential armed career criminal status does not constitute ineffective assistance.

"N.E. 817, 818 (1919). There is sufficient evidence to find that Degnan knowingly interfered with Hagen’s obligation to his employer from early 1972 until the time the action was filed in this case. However, there is no evidence to link either Mary Ann Hagen or Charlotte J. Degnan to the manufacturing or sales efforts of Knight and, therefore, no purpose would be served by issuing an injunction against them. In order to avoid irreparable injury to plaintiff, a limited preliminary injunction should issue, pursuant to Rule 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, against defendants Howard D. Hagen, Earl J. Degnan and Knight Industrial Supplies, Inc. Mixing Equipment Co. v. Philadelphia Gear, Inc., supra;  REDACTED Defendants argue that the injunction should not issue because the amount of business taken by Knight from Fuller is small when compared to the total Fuller business, and because an injunction would impose a severe hardship upon both Hagen and Degnan and their families. After carefully considering these arguments, the court has nevertheless, under all of the circumstances, concluded that the injunction should issue.

"is actually in the nature of alimony, maintenance, or support. 11 U.S.C. § 523(a)(5). “The spouse seeking a determination that an obligation is nondischargeable on the grounds that it was actually in the nature of alimony, maintenance or support, has the burden of proof.” Mackey v. Kaufman (In re Kaufman), 115 B.R. 435, 439 (Bankr.E.D.N.Y.1990). In this case, Mrs. Sculler and the Nagel Firm shoulder that burden. The nature of the legal fees is the basis of the determination of whether or not they are dischargeable. If the obligation to pay legal fees is in the nature of alimony, maintenance or support, it is nondis-chargeable. See Brody v. Brody (In re Brody), 3 F.3d 35, 38 (2nd Cir.1993);  REDACTED Leslie v.

"Vacate, we agree with the bankruptcy court that Maloof failed to demonstrate circumstances to warrant relief. Typically, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60 is a litigant’s only avenue for altering a final judgment. Indeed, Maloof brought both his First Motion to Vacate and his Second Motion to Vacate under Rule 60(b)(6). However, Rule 60 also provides a savings clause, which allows a judgment to be attacked for fraud on the court regardless of the passage of time. Fed. R.Civ.P. 60(d)(3); see Marcelli v.

Thus, a sentence within the prescribed statutory limits generally will not be found to be cruel and unusual. Id. at 253. An analysis of the proportionality of a sentence should be guided by objective criteria, including comparison of the sentence imposed with (1) the gravity of the offense; (2) sentences imposed on other criminals in the same jurisdiction; and (3) sentences imposed on others convicted of the same crime in other jurisdictions. Solem, 463 U.S. at 290-92, 103 S.Ct. at 3009-11. While it is true that no sentence is per se constitutional, proportionality challenges of particular sentences, excepting those involving capital punishment, have rarely been successful.

"of the Board of Immigration Appeals’ (BIA) decision dismissing his appeal of the Immigration Judge’s (IJ) order that he was removable and denying his request for cancellation of removal. He claims that his prior offense, under Texas Penal Code § 22.01, assault of a family-member, is not a crime involving moral turpitude, rendering him ineligible for cancellation of removal. He suggests that his assault conviction was for reckless rather than intentional conduct. He argues that his assault offense did not involve moral turpitude because § 22.01(a) requires only bodily injury rather than serious bodily injury as an element of the crime. We apply a two-part standard of review to the BIA’s conclusion that Chancoy-To-noc committed a crime involving moral turpitude. See  REDACTED First, we accord substantial deference to the BIA’s interpretation of the Immigration and Nationality Act and its definition of the phrase “moral turpitude.” Id. Second, we review de novo whether the elements of a state or federal crime fit the BIA’s definition of a crime involving moral turpitude. Id. The BIA’s determination of what constitutes moral turpitude must be upheld if it is reasonable. Hamdan v. INS, 98 F.3d 183, 185 (5th Cir.1996). Since § 22.01 has multiple subsections and is phrased in the disjunctive, such that some violations of the statute would involve moral turpitude and others not, this court has found that § 22.01 is not categorically a crime involving moral turpitude.

Because that petition was denied on June 28, 2005, however, a remand now would effectuate no change in the case. As a result, Shehadeh’s challenge to the IJ’s continuance denial is moot. See Qureshi v. Gonzales, 442 F.3d 985, 988 (7th Cir.2006). Shehadeh also claims that the BIA abused its discretion in denying his motion to reopen the removal proceedings. This claim presents a ‘live’ controversy because we remain capable of fashioning an appropriate form of relief. See  REDACTED We review the BIA’s denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. Uriostegui v. Gonzales, 415 F.3d 660, 663 (7th Cir.2005). The motion to reopen was based on Shehadeh’s claim that he received ineffective assistance of counsel before the IJ and the BIA. According to Shehadeh, his counsel’s failure to submit evidence in a timely manner caused the IJ to question the validity of the marriage and therefore to deny the continuance motion.

Curry also claims that he was indicted by a grand jury which did not adequately represent a cross-section of the community, since non-freeholders were systematically excluded. The district court denied relief without an evidentiary hearing, on the basis that Curry had failed to allege prejudice as a result of the grand jury selection system.

"Buckeye Incubator Company, one of the plaintiffs, as assignee of S. B. Smith, the other plaintiff, for methods and apparatus for incubating eggs. The claims have been repeatedly held valid by appellate courts and quite irregularly held infringed and not infringed. For the literature of the subject, the prior art, the prosecution of the application through the Patent Office, the subject of the invention, and interpretations of the claims as eventually allowed and sustained, we refer as a convenient starting point for this discussion to the decisions in Buckeye Incubator Co. v.

At sentencing, the district judge found that the quantity of cocaine involved in the offenses put Allen’s base offense level at 34. The judge then adjusted Allen’s offense level to 36 to account for his role in the offenses and his criminal history level. Thus, Allen’s Guideline range was 210-262 months. On October 2, 1989, the judge sentenced Allen to 210 months of imprisonment on each count, with the sentences to run concurrently. On direct appeal, we affirmed Allen’s sentence and conviction.

Id. at 788, 103 S.Ct. at 1569. Deibler seeks constitutional protection for his right to seek elective office to promote the association’s views, and also for the act of not paying taxes. If appellant had paid his taxes, he would not have been denied the opportunity to represent the views of the association as a candidate. This court has held that First Amendment freedoms are not abridged by the obligation to pay taxes.

Younger, supra, 401 U.S. at 43-44, 91 S.Ct. at 750.

It is not because of chance that these litigants may seek federal relief, it is because the Supreme Court in this context has refused to require exhaustion of state remedies. See, e.g., Steffel, supra, 415 U.S. at 473, 94 S.Ct. at 1222. Since there is no pending state prosecution against Waldron, he is entitled to a federal forum.

Florio did not remove under § 1443, which covers civil rights cases, so a straightforward reading of § 1447(d) forecloses his effort to get appellate review. Yet just as the Court refused in Murphy Brothers to read § 1446(b) literally, so it has declined to read § 1447(d) literally. A series of cases beginning with Thermtron Products, Inc. v.

As long as a district court’s remand is based on a timely raised defect in removal procedure or on lack of subject-matter jurisdiction—the grounds for remand recognized by § 1447(c)—a court of appeals lacks jurisdiction to entertain an appeal of the remand order under § 1447(d). 516 U.S. at 127-28, 116 S.Ct. 494 (citation omitted).

They simply maintain that the balance of convenience tips decidedly in favor of this action being litigated in Texas.

In considering the defendants’ request, the Court is mindful of the fact that mechanical application of the “first-filed” rule is to be avoided.

"estate taxes, as well: Robert, Jr. and Richard satisfied several years of outstanding real estate taxes after the Horsting parents’ deaths. II. Conclusions of Law A. Burden of Proof The government bears the burden of proving its case by a preponderance of the evidence. Cf. United States v. Berman, 825 F.2d 1053, 1057 (6th Cir.1987). B. Federal Tax Liens When the government makes assessments and the taxpayer’s taxes remain unpaid after notice and demand, federal tax liens attach to “all property and rights to property, whether real or personal” of that taxpayer. 26 U.S.C. §§ 6321, 6322 (2006). Tax liens are “continuing” and so attach to all property owned by the taxpayer during the life of the liens.  REDACTED There is no question that tax liens attached to the Horsting parents’ property when assessments were made between 1985 and 1990. Rather, the question is whether the government has satisfied its burden of establishing that the 1727 property belonged to the Horsting parents. C. Applicable Law The property rights of the taxpayer are determined by state law, because the federal tax lien statute does not define property rights, “but merely attaches consequences, federally defined, to rights created under state law.” United States v. Swan, 467 F.3d 655, 656 (7th Cir.2006) (quoting United States v. Nat’l Bank of Commerce, 472 U.S. 713, 722, 105 S.Ct. 2919, 86 L.Ed.2d 565 (1985)). Federal law then “determines whether those",517442

Courts look to the parties’ contractual relationship in the light of state law to determine whether there is a valid and enforceable basis for setoff before considering whether it would be equitable to allow it. See Butner v. U.S., 440 U.S. 48, 55, 99 S.Ct. 914, 918, 59 L.Ed.2d 136 (1979); Boston and Maine Corporation v.

"the Failure to Bring an Article 78 Proceeding The State Defendants’ final two arguments both deal with the third element of a procedural due process claim: whether the deprivation of a property or liberty interest “occurred without constitutionally adequate pre- or post-deprivation process.” Does, 2005 WL 900620, at *8. The third argument addresses the question of whether the State Defendants applied the “some credible evidence” standard which was held to violate due process in Valmonte. The fourth argument implies that plaintiffs claim relates to “random, unauthorized acts by state employees,” and did not violate procedural due process because the State provides a meaningful post-deprivation remedy in the form of an Article 78 proceeding. See  REDACTED Since this Court has already determined that plaintiff has not adequately pled the first element of a procedural due process claim, it is unnecessary to determine whether plaintiff received constitutionally adequate due process prior to or following the deprivation of that interest. However, if this Court were to address these arguments, it would determine that the facts alleged by plaintiff do not make out this third element of a due process claim.

The United States Supreme Court has held conclusively that § 2255 was enacted to provide in the sentencing court a remedy exactly commensurate with that which had previously been available by habeas corpus in the court of the district where the prisoner was confined, Hill v. United States, 368 U.S. 424, 427, 82 S.Ct. 468, 7 L.Ed.2d 417 (1962), and that, in appropriate cases, it can also be utilized to provide a more flexible remedy.  REDACTED Moreover, if relief is possible under § 2255, it is the exclusive remedy and habeas corpus is barred for a federal prisoner. Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure: Criminal § 591. Relator must show, therefore, that a § 2255 motion is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.

"the action would be manifestly contrary to the public policy of the United States.

Numerous provisions of chapter 15 give the Court flexibility in tailoring its rulings. .If section 1334(c)(1) could be applied to Count I in this case, the Court would in fact abstain from hearing Count I. Most of the usual factors considered in ruling on a permissive abstention motion are satisfied here. See  REDACTED If discretionary abstention was exercised, there would be little effect on administration of the chapter 15 case, and likely little effect on the administration of the case pending in the SVG Court, as the plaintiff would seek the same relief elsewhere. Count I presents issues entirely outside of bankruptcy law; there is no need to consider the feasibility of severing such claims from bankruptcy matters as no bankruptcy matters are present. The sole basis for jurisdiction here is 28 U.S.C. § 1334.

"report to be proper because it only performed simply arithmetic operations based on information already in the record, which the bankruptcy court could have done itself. However, the report also assumes that Boisrond’s expenses were essentially the same each year. As far as we can tell, this assumption was without basis in the record. Boisrond was not even asked in her deposition whether her expenses were approximately the same. Furthermore, contrary to the district court’s analysis, the accuracy of this estimate of Boisrond’s expenses could impact whether Boisrond was insolvent during the relevant period. Net worth can be extrapolated backwards, starting with net worth at a given time, by subtracting the difference between expenses and income over the interim period. Cf.  REDACTED Indeed this appears to be the methodology Plotzker used. Thus, a higher net worth will be recorded as of the beginning of a year if expenses greatly exceeded income during the course of that year, such that expenses eroded net worth during that period. Therefore, the district court’s attempt to maximize Boisrond’s net worth during the relevant period by assuming her expenses were zero during these years represented an erroneous understanding of how the net worth calculation was made. Boisrond could have been solvent during the prior years only if her expenses were very high not very low. Therefore, in order to have been solvent at any time during",608991

In that document, plaintiffs primarily distinguished their sex discrimination and privacy claims from those asserted in I.C.U.

To answer that question, we look to federal common law, which incorporates “general principles of contract and agency law.” Id at 144. Examples of such principles include incorporation by reference, assumption, agency, alter ego, estoppel, and third-party beneficiary. See id. at 146-50,  REDACTED The theories asserted by Dynamex on appeal include (1) that Ouadani is bound to arbitrate inasmuch as he is an “agent” of SBS, (2) that Ouadani should be equitably es-topped from refusing to arbitrate, and (3) that Ouadani is bound by the arbitration clause because he is a third-party beneficiary of the Agreement. A. Agency Dynamex asserts that Ouadani should be bound to arbitrate because he is an “agent” of SBS. We disagree. Dynamex notes that the arbitration clause in the Agreement reaches disputes “brought by [SBS], Dynamex or any agent acting on behalf of either.” (emphasis added).

The “benchmark” percentage for this standard has been 25%, with the ordinary range for attorney’s fees between 20 - 30%.  REDACTED Court Awarded Attorney Fees, 108 F.R.D. at 247, n. 32. Accepted by the Sixth Circuit as a valid means to determine attorney’s fees, the following six factors should be analyzed to ensure the award’s reasonableness: the value of the benefit rendered to the class, the value of the services on an hourly basis, whether the services were undertaken on a contingent fee basis, the benefit to society, the complexity of the litigation and the professional skill and standing of counsel. Bowling v. Pfizer Inc., 102 F.3d 777, 780 (6th Cir.1996); Smillie, 710 F.2d at 275.

The lifeboat tackle and other equipment which were purchased for the vessel in 1938 were not subject to the same amount of depreciation as the hull itself. The application of any one of the several rates of depreciation does not necessarily lead to the proper conclusion as to value.

The plaintiff is entitled to recover $21,164.25 with interest thereon at the rate of 4 percent per annum from October 12, 1942, to the date of payment; and in addition thereto, interest at the same rate on $60,000 from August 1, 1942 to October 12, 1942, the interest in each case being allowed not as interest but as a part of just compensation.

"basis for counts four and six (regarding the lien waiver and subcontract agreement between MBI and B & G) had the requisite materiality as required by 18 U.S.C. § 1001. Appellants argue that the lien waiver was incapable of inducing payment because an HDCIC official testified that HDCIC did not require the document as HDCIC had no security interest in the Citadel project due to the fact that MBI’s loan was secured by a letter of credit. Further, appellants argue that the subcontract agreement between MBI and B & G dated January 7, 1982, was incapable of inducing payment because the auditor for HDCIC retained the agreement in its file rather than passing it along to HDCIC or HUD. In  REDACTED  this court set out the standard for determining materiality of a false statement for purposes of 18 U.S.C. § 1001: To establish materiality of a false statement it is not necessary to show that a government agency actually relied on the statement, that the government suffered pecuniary loss as a result of the statement, or that the false statement was sufficient to induce a payment or benefit. Rather, materiality involves only the capability of influencing an agency’s governmental functions, i.e., does the statement have a “natural tend ency to influence or is it capable of influencing agency decision?” Id. at 1188 (citations omitted). In the present case, the submission of the lien waiver and subcontract agreement by appellants served to convince",597595

Richardson does not meet the criteria for the issuance of a writ of mandate, because he has not demonstrated that the district court’s order was clear error as a matter of law. See Bauman v.

Although the district court used different phrases in referring to the fees properly chargeable to Richardson under the Koch standard (fees “not likely to be useful” to Brother International Corporation (“BIC”) and fees “not useful” to BIC), this was not clear error because Koch itself used different formulations of the standard at different times, including formulations similar to those used by the district court.

"Foremost highlights the need for its inclusion in the ongoing coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings. Thus, transfer of Foremost will ensure the most just and expeditious procession of that action as well as the litigation taken as a whole. AMPI alternatively seeks an order from the Panel separating and remanding Foremost’s Robinson-Patman Act claim to the Northern District of Texas pursuant to Section 1407(a). The sole argument made in support of this request is that the Texas court presently has before it certain motions to dismiss filed by AMPI. We see no reason for granting this request, however, because these motions can be presented to and determined by the transferee judge following the transfer we are herewith ordering. See  REDACTED It is therefore ordered that, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1407, the action entitled Foremost-McKesson, Inc. v.

The court observed that “pension plans and stock purchases may be a wise investment which enhance an individual’s financial security, but the debtor is not entitled to acquire them at the expense of unpaid creditors.” 54 B.R. at 538. In this case, the debtor’s repayment of the retirement account loan essentially repays himself while not paying his general unsecured debts. The bankruptcy administrator correctly observes that it is reasonable to want to preserve retirement savings and to avoid tax consequences, but entirely unfair to do so to the detriment of creditors. The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit recently addressed this issue in  REDACTED In Behlke, the court held that voluntary contributions to a 401K or other retirement plan should be considered disposable income, just as a debtor’s repayment of loans made from an ERISA-quali-fied profit sharing account should be treated as disposable income. Behlke, 358 F.3d at 435 (citing In re Harshbarger, 66 F.3d 775, 777-78 (6th Cir.1995)) (repayment of loans to a retirement account was prudent but unfair to creditors receiving less than a 100% dividend). In this case, the bankruptcy administrator reports that the debtor is required by the State of North Carolina to contribute 6% of his income to a retirement account. Accordingly, the debtor’s retirement fund will continue to grow even with a suspension of his repayment of the loan",586552
"saw the agreement between the store and the bank, but instead simply received the aforementioned notice informing them that “[ejffective immediately, credit is being extended by the May National Bank of Arizona.” We find this argument unavailing to defeat federal jurisdiction. The 1996 account transfer was not, in our view, an “addition” of a party to the contract, as discussed in Denver Metropolitan Association — a case presenting the question whether a collective bargaining agreement prohibited employers who were not members of a signatory trade association from contributing to certain employee trust funds. See id. at 1369-71. Rather, the transfer in the instant case was an assignment — a shifting of contractual rights and duties to another. See  REDACTED Northwest Airlines, Inc., 6 F.3d 492, 495 n. 4 (7th Cir.1993)). In general, unless the original contract or a relevant statute specifies otherwise, a party may assign contractual rights without notice. See United States v.

VI(A) The district court correctly noted the majority interpretation of Section 215(a)(3) is that even an informal, internal complaint may constitute protected activity: This Court has followed the majority position that an employee’s informal complaint to his employer may constitute protected activity under Section 215(a)(3). See Dearmon v. Tex. Migrant Council, Inc., 252 F.Supp.2d 367, 367-68 (S.D.Tex.2003) (Kazen, J.); Truex v.

But see Lambert v. Genesee Hosp., 10 F.3d 46, 55 (2d Cir.1993) (requiring the filing of a formal complaint with a government agency).

The “informal complaint” interpretation is not the only one. For example, in Lambert v.

See, e.g.,  REDACTED Under the statute, Customs is afforded the discretion to choose the “form and manner” of providing notice to the importer of an extension of liquidation. As demonstrated by the regulations, Customs has chosen the ordinary mailing of a Form 4333-A to provide such notice to the importer. There is nothing to indicate that this means of providing notice fails to comply with Customs’ statutory mandate. As the Supreme Court has noted, a letter properly directed that is placed in the mail or delivered to a postal carrier is presumed to have reached its destination and to have been received by the person to whom it was addressed.

See  REDACTED Contrary to Naidu’s contention, the BIA did not violate her due process rights by denying the motion to reopen without holding an evidentiary hearing.

"error. The motion states that during a court recess the plaintiff accused one of defendants’ witnesses of testifying to a falsehood. The affidavits of two persons were to the effect that this accusation was made in a loud voice while plaintiff was in an angry mood; that members of the jury were nearby and could have heard the accusation and conversation between the witness and plaintiff. A mistrial or a new trial may be granted when remarks about a case are made within the hearing of the jury, which the court believes may have influenced the jury to the prejudice of either party, but the action of the court on such motions is discretionary. 89 C.J.S.

To establish the link, Strozyk must produce evidence """"sufficient to raise the inference that her protected activity was the likely reason for the adverse employment action."""" Id. at 259 (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted). Specifically, Strozyk argues that the temporal proximity and the pattern of antagonism establish that her complaint was likely the reason for the discipline and her firing. The Court first notes that the two-month gap between Strozyk's complaint and the first disciplinary act, while probative, is not so """"unusually suggestive of retaliatory motive"""" that the timing alone might establish the necessary causal connection.  REDACTED Thomas v. Town of Hammonton, 351 F.3d 108, 114 (3d Cir. 2003) (finding that three weeks was not unusually suggestive). The Court next examines whether any reasonable jury could conclude that an intervening pattern of antagonism arose after Strozyk's complaint. As stated, Strozyk primarily relies on the series of disciplinary actions to support her argument that such a pattern existed. An initial weakness in Strozyk's argument is that she admits to most of the conduct underlying the discipline and that imposition of discipline was not against the Hospital's policy. For example, Strozyk admits that her discipline on January 5, 2015 and February 5, 2016 for excessive absences""",790024
"States Constitution other than those expressly reserved for citizens.”)- Courts have recognized that a right to privacy is related to equal protection and due process. This right has been defined as the “right to be let alone.” See Hill v. Colorado, 530 U.S. 703, 716-17, 120 S.Ct. 2480, 2489-90, 147 L.Ed.2d 597, 612 (2000) (citing Olmstead v.

Oklahoma, 316 U.S. 535, 62 S.Ct. 1110, 86 L.Ed. 1655 (1942), and the right to marry, see Loving v.

See, e.g., Santosky v. Kramer, 455 U.S. 745, 102 S.Ct. 1388, 71 L.Ed.2d 599 (1982) (parental right to guide children’s upbringing); Moore v.

"with the proposition that the substitution was obvious, Alford countered with the time-honored answer that even if it appeared so on its face it nevertheless resulted in a patentable invention since the advantages produced were substantial and unpredictable, establishing them by affidavit evidence. I have no doubt that under a long line of cases in this court, as well as in other courts, such proof with respect to an admittedly new combination would have been found acceptable to establish patentability prior to 1952, when the requirement of “invention” was put into the statute, 35 U.S.C. 103, in terms of what would be unobvious to one of ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention was made.  REDACTED 74 USPQ 155. Since section 103 clearly was not included in the statute for the purpose of making it more difficult for the inventors of new combinations to obtain patents on their inventions which produce new, unexpected, and advantageous results which would (by virtue of unexpectedness) not have been obvious, I can see no reason for ignoring established case law. A casual perusal of the legislative history of section 103 will show that the intent was that it should have exactly the opposite eifect it is being given in this case. The majority appears to accept the adequacy of Alford’s evidence of advantages, saying: Although the examiner and the board have questioned the significance of a comparative test between these two devices",259612

Thompson, 593 F.2d 1375, 1387 (5th Cir.1979). In Smith the prosecutor argued that the “at least in part standard” placed too low of a threshold on the plaintiff to make a case for retaliation because that standard, in effect, made any showing of retaliatory motive sufficient to meet the plaintiffs burden. The Smith court addressed this concern by explaining that the “at least in part” language must be read in conjunction with the clear holding in Wilson that the state may have many legitimate reasons for bringing a criminal prosecution and that it is only when the state’s primary purpose is to retaliate for protected conduct that a plaintiffs rights",679472
"prospective litigant effectively may vindicate [his or her] statutory cause of action in the arbitral forum, the statute will continue to serve both its remedial and deterrent function.” See Gilmer, 500 U.S. at 28, 111 S.Ct. 1647. In light of Gilmer, the U.S. Courts of Appeals for the Tenth, Eleventh, and D.C. Circuits have found that arbitration agreements that require a Title VII plaintiff to pay all or part of an arbitrator’s fee are unenforceable because they do not provide for a forum where litigants can effectively vindicate their statutory rights. See Shankle v. B-G Maintenance Management of Colo., Inc., 163 F.3d 1230, 1235 (10th Cir.1999); Paladino v. Avnet Computer Technologies, Inc., 134 F.3d 1054, 1062 (11th Cir.1998);  REDACTED The panel in Cole reasoned that because litigants would never be required to pay for the services of a judge, arbitration in which the plaintiff is required to pay the arbitrator’s fees cannot be a reasonable substitute for a judicial forum and is therefore an inadequate forum for the vindication of Title VII rights. See Cole, 105 F.3d at 1484. Other circuits have found that the possibility that a plaintiff may be required to pay arbitration fees is not, by itself, a sufficient reason to invalidate an agreement to arbitrate Title VII claims at the outset of an action because the arbitral panel may not in fact require the plaintiff to pay fees and, if a plaintiff believes that excessive fees",201341

Summary judgment on Davis’s claims for damages under RLUIPA was proper because RLUIPA does not allow for damages against individuals sued in their official or individual capacities.

The language of the statute and rule does not require such a bizarre result. The statute and rule are not confined in terms to consummated purchases or sales. They have often been applied where, as here, “plaintiffs alleged that they had sought to enter a securities transaction as purchasers or sellers, but that the transaction was aborted as a result of the fraud of the defendants.” Mount Clemens Industries, Inc. v.

In Harris, the defendant was charged, under § 924(c)(1)(A), with carrying a firearm in the course of committing a drug trafficking crime. The mandatory minimum sentence based on the jury's verdict alone was five years, but the District Court imposed a 7-year mandatory minimum sentence based on its finding, by a preponderance of evidence, that the defendant also brandished the firearm. As in this case, Harris challenged his sentence on the ground that the 7-year mandatory minimum sentence was unconstitutional under Apprendi, even though the judge's finding did not alter the maximum sentence to which he was exposed.

It is authoritatively established that the denial of a discharge in bankruptcy is a bar to discharge from the same debts in a second bankruptcy proceeding. Freshman v.

In light of this analysis, the central factual question is whether the relevant work papers and private communications were made pursuant to one or more of the target individuals seeking legal advice from a professional he either perceived to be an attorney or an attorney’s agent.

A prima facie case of political discrimination based on the First Amendment consists of four elements: “(1) that the plaintiff and defendant have opposing political affiliations, (2) that the defendant is aware of the plaintiffs affiliation, (3) that an adverse employment action occurred, and (4) that political affiliation was a substantial or motivating factor for the adverse employment action.” Lamboy-Ortiz v.

"135 L.Ed.2d 700 (1996). No doubt Congress intended to preempt less favorable state law tolling provisions for certain toxic tort cases. The question raised here is the intended scope of such preemption. If the extent of Congress’s preemptive intent is unclear, the presumption favors a finding of limited preemption. Id. The terms used in § 9658 to describe the scope of preemption are those used throughout CERCLA. Each of these— “hazardous substance,” “release,” “facility” — has a specific statutory definition. The CERCLA definitions are extremely broad, but even CERCLA has exclusions from its coverage. Moreover, the statute’s regime of notification, remediation and shared cleanup liability has been characterized by this court as pertaining to “abandoned,” not “existing” sites. See  REDACTED 25 (citing O’Reilly, et al., RCRA and Superfund § 2.02, at 2-3 (stating that “CERC-LA applies to abandoned sites, and RCRA deals with today’s generators”)). Thus, it might be argued that § 9658 is confined to claims arising from hazardous waste sites where CERCLA enforcement actions have been taken or pursued, whether by government or private parties.

Healy Tibbitts Construction Company, 713 F.2d at 1477; Matter of Vest Transportation Company, Inc., 434 F.Supp. 748, 749-750 (N.D.Miss.1977). One court has upheld the imposition of a civil penalty of $2,000 for a spill of five to 15 gallons.  REDACTED Counsel have not found any reported cases where the civil penalty imposed under 33 U.S.C. § 1321(b)(6)(A) was found to be arbitrary and capricious. Defendant Chotin complains that the civil penalties assessed were arbitrary and capricious. However, the civil penalties in these cases were properly assessed under the statutory criteria. As required by 33 U.S.C. § 1321(b)(6)(A), the Coast Guard considered the appropriateness of the penalty to the size of the business of the owner, the effect on the owner to continue its business, and the gravity of the violation. Chotin does not argue that the penalty was not appropriate for",517702
"district court concluded Idaho statutes regarding rights and duties under conservation easements, see Idaho Code § 55-2102, precluded the court from granting the relief sought. The district court erred in concluding its power to grant relief was limited by state law. Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief under a federal statute which empowers a federal court to “compel agency action unlawfully withheld,” and to “hold unlawful and set aside agency action ... in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right_” 5 U.S.C. § 706(1), (2)(C). These provisions authorize the district court, in the exercise of its jurisdiction under the federal statute, to void a property transaction and order a transfer of title where necessary.  REDACTED In Goldschmidt a citizens’ group brought suit under NEPA to enjoin the federally-financed sale of an airport until an environmental impact statement could be completed. The district court entered summary judgment against plaintiffs, and the sale was completed. On appeal, defendants argued completion of the sale rendered the case moot because the court could no longer fashion an appropriate remedy. We rejected this argument: [T]he actions here can be undone.... [A]ll parties to the transactions are before the Court. If appellants were to prevail on the merits of this appeal, this Court could remand with instructions to the District Court to order a transfer of the Airport title back to [the original owner]....

"without merit. Finally, as to Plaintiffs’ complaint that Defendants completely omitted any discus sion of the effects of aerial refueling on any noise data related to the underlying land tracts, Defendants agree that Plaintiffs’ statement is true. However, Defendants contend there is no significance to Plaintiffs’ comments regarding this issue because aerial refueling tracks are defined as airspace normally at or above 20,000 MSL. Defendants argue that Plaintiffs cannot demonstrate any relevant adverse environmental noise impacts related to aerial refueling that should have been considered by the decisionmaker. Judicial Determination The CEQ intended that agencies compare the potential impacts of a proposed major federal action to the known impacts of maintaining the status quo.  REDACTED In other words, requiring consideration of the No Action alternative constitutes use of the current level of activity as a benchmark. See Forty Most Asked Questions Concerning CEQ’s [NEPA] Regulations, 46 Fed.Reg, 18,026 (Mar. 23, 1981). However, while informed and meaningful consideration of reasonable alternatives is an integral part of the statutory scheme, Friends of Southeast’s Future v. Morrison, 153 F.3d 1059, 1065 (9th Cir.1998), this Court notes, and Plaintiffs specifically acknowledge, that “[a] baseline is not an independent legal requirement.” 54 Fed.Reg. 23,756 (1989).

The RICO statute defines racketeering activity by a list of crimes, or “predicate offenses,” including federal crimes such as bribery, mail, fraud and wire fraud. 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1). In this case, the plaintiffs allege that the predicate offenses consisted of mail and wire fraud. The elements of mail and wire fraud are: (1) a scheme or artifice to defraud for the purpose of obtaining money or property, (2) participation by the defendant with specific intent to defraud, and (3) use of the mails or wire transmissions in furtherance of the scheme. United States v. Riley, 621 F.3d 312, 329 (3d Cir.2010);  REDACTED The defendants argue that the instant case does not fall under RICO, but is essentially a breach of contract action. The court addressed this same argument in the Suessenbach action. As discussed in Suessenbach, the plaintiffs here are alleging something more than a simple breach of contract claim. The plaintiffs are alleging that the defendants entered into an unlawful agreement to purposefully charge inflated gathering and transportation costs for the specific purpose of disguising the true nature of the deductions from lessors’ royalty payments. Thus, beyond the terms of their contracts, of which none of the named defendants are parties, the plaintiffs allege that the defendants engaged in fraudulent transactions specifi cally to disguise the fact that",27849

The Sixth Circuit thus allows a plaintiff to proceed under both claims and appears to follow the same prima facie elements for both claims. While the Sixth Circuit never has clearly stated that the same prima facie case standards apply to § 501 and § 504 claims, it appears best to follow the general language set forth in Burns and apply the same standard to plaintiffs § 501 and § 504 claims.

Because defendant has not disputed whether plaintiff is disabled, the plaintiff has met her prima facie case on this issue. .

"L.Ed.2d 763 (2007). Johnson alleges three state-created impediments: (1) the “turmoil” surrounding Florida’s implementation of its post-conviction representation system, which delayed the appointment of Johnson’s original state post-conviction counsel until August 9, 1998; (2) the ineffective assistance of Johnson’s original state post-conviction counsel in not filing Rule 3.850 motions; and (3) the State’s objection, on privilege and attorney-work-product grounds, to Johnson’s current counsel’s request, filed in February 2000, for access to documents needed in preparing Johnson’s state post-conviction filings. The problem for Johnson is the United States Supreme Court has held that prisoners in capital cases have no constitutional right to post-conviction counsel. See  REDACTED Murray v. Giarratano, 492 U.S. 1, 10, 12, 109 S.Ct. 2765, 2771-72, 106 L.Ed.2d 1 (1989); Pennsylvania v. Finley, 481 U.S. 551, 555-57, 107 S.Ct. 1990, 1993-94, 95 L.Ed.2d 539 (1987). Thus, a state’s delay in appointing such counsel is not a “violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States,” as required by § 2244(d)(1)(B). And this Court has already held that “incompetent” performance by appointed counsel “is not the type of State impediment envisioned in § 2244(d)(1)(B).” Lawrence I, 421 F.3d at 1226. Later, in Gordon v.

"trial of the First Amendment claim. The jury trial of the First Amendment claim resulted in a verdict for the members of the school board, and judgment to that effect was duly entered. The claim that Peters and Epperson were entitled to a hearing before nonrenewal was later tried to the court, based on the record as made at the jury trial on the First Amendment claim. The trial court held that Peters and Epperson had a sufficient property interest to entitle them to a hearing before any final determination was made not to renew their teaching contracts. However, judgment was entered in favor of the members of the school board sued as individuals, on the ground of a qualified privilege.  REDACTED School Disk No. 1, Albany County, Wyo., 522 F.2d 1171 (10th Cir. 1975). As concerns the members of the school board sued in their official capacity, the trial court concluded that notwithstanding the fact that Peters and Epperson were not afforded the hearing to which they were entitled, no money judgment for back pay could be entered because of the Eleventh Amendment. The trial court further concluded that under the circumstances, namely, a jury having found that the teaching contracts of both Peters and Epperson were not renewed because of budgetary problems, and not because of the exercise by them of their First Amendment rights, reinstatement was “inappropriate.” Accordingly, judgment was entered in",18675

"a Section 1983 claim for false arrest in violation of the Fourth Amendment, as he has averred that the Individual Defendants arrested him and assisted in his prosecution (which resulted in his being detained, i.e., seized, between arrest and acquittal), in spite of evidence that was squarely inconsistent with his guilt. For example, according to Plaintiff, these Defendants arrested Plaintiff in spite of the fact that Plaintiff had a hard plaster cast on his left arm, a fact not mentioned by any of the witnesses to the murder when describing the participants in the shooting, and that Plaintiff was identified by a lineup witness after that witness had been coached. This is sufficient to make plausible Plaintiffs false arrest claim. See  REDACTED Thus, while a law enforcement officer has no constitutional duty to “prove the plaintiffs version of the events wrong before arresting him,” Rheingold, 568 F.Supp.2d at 392, or to “explore and eliminate every theoretically plausible claim of innocence before making an arrest,” Ricciuti v. N.Y. City Transit Auth., 124 F.3d 123, 128 (2d Cir.1997), Plaintiff has alleged that the individually named defendants pursued their arrest of Plaintiff in the knowing absence of probable cause, and that these defendants subsequently assisted the prosecutor in misleading the Grand Jury and withholding exculpatory information from Plaintiff before and during trial.

To determine whether a plaintiff is pressing an independent claim or merely seeking review of a state judgment, we ask whether the state judgment caused the plaintiffs alleged injuries. See Gen.

Similarly barred by Rooker-Feldman are Daggett’s challenges to Judge Key’s orders denying him a hearing; those attacks are an obvious attempt to sidestep an appeal from those orders through the state system.

So stated, the argument would apply to all zoning. As a matter purely of detailed specifications, the requirements imposed on other sorts of buildings in other zones are substantially as complicated as those imposed on the owners of mobile home parks. What was critical in Burton and McQueen, and is lacking here, is a continuing interrelatedness on both the financial and operational levels. In making a slightly different argument, plaintiff cites Marsh v. Alabama, 326 U.S. 501, 66 S.Ct. 276, 90 L.Ed. 265 (1946), and  REDACTED At base his contention is that since the owner of a complete town (including business and residential sections) was held subject to the Fourteenth Amendment in Marsh, and the owner of “the community business block” was similarly charged in Logan Plaza, the owner of a residential section should be held to the same standard. Despite the attractive symmetry of the argument, we do not understand Marsh and Logan Valley to go so far. The Court emphasized in Marsh that the area in question was “freely accessible and open to the people in the area and those passing through”, 326 U.S. at 508, 66 S.Ct. at 279, and quoted this passage in Logan Plaza, 391 U.S. at",299204
"federal common law, the federal nature of a program alone does not demonstrate a need for uniformity. That analysis applies equally here. Neither the parties to this appeal nor any case we could find articulate any reason for uniformity of interpretation other than the very one Atherton rejected. None even takes notice of Atherton. Not proscribed by Atherton is a narrower ground for applying federal common law. Clearfield Trust Co. v. United States, 318 U.S. 363, 744, 63 S.Ct. 573, 87 L.Ed. 838 (1943), establishes that, when the duties or rights of the United States are at stake under a federal program, that federal interest requires the application (and if necessary the creation) of federal law. For example,  REDACTED  considered what law governs the priority of liens that secure federal agencies’ loans to private parties. The Court reasoned, citing Clearfield Trust, that the liens implicated the agencies’ rights under federal programs created by “specific Acts of Congress”, which meant that federal law had to apply— though the Court then borrowed that federal law from state law.

Beuke next asserts that the Ohio appellate courts failed to determine whether his sentence was proportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases or, put differently, that the Ohio courts failed to review his sentence for comparative proportionality. Beuke specifically contends that his death sentence was disproportionate to the sentences imposed against ten other defendants who were convicted of aggravated murder in the same Ohio county but who did not receive the death penalty. This claim is meritless. This circuit has consistently interpreted the Supreme Court precedents to hold that comparative proportionality review is not required by the Constitution. Most recently, in our en banc opinion in  REDACTED  we explained the distinction between the proportionality required by the Eighth Amendment and the comparative proportionality that the petitioner in Getsy — -like Beuke in the case before us here — sought. Eighth Amendment proportionality, as defined by the Supreme Court, refers “to an abstract evaluation of the appropriateness of a sentence for a particular crime.” Proportionality as defined by the Supreme Court evaluates a particular defendant’s culpability for his crime in relation to the punishment that he has received.

Claim Construction and Summary Judgment Standards To evaluate whether the defendants infringe the ’003 patent, the court must undertake a two-step analysis. Markman v.

Second, the court must compare the claims, as con strued by the court, to the accused processes to determine whether all of the claim limitations are present. Id. To construe the disputed claims of a patent, the court must examine the intrinsic evidence, which includes the claims of the patent, the patent specification, and the prosecution history.  REDACTED The court begins by examining the patent claims themselves and giving those terms their ordinary meaning to one of skill in the art. Hockerson-Halberstadt, Inc. v. Avia Group Int’l, Inc., 222 F.3d 951, 955 (Fed.Cir.2000). The court can use a dictionary to aid its analysis of the meaning of nontechnical terms. Interactive Gift Express, Inc. v. CompuServe Inc., 256 F.3d 1323, 1332 n. 1 (Fed.Cir.2001). The patent’s specification aids the construction of claim terms by explaining and illustrating the claimed invention.

The district court in Southeast Guar. Trust, however, also recognized that Obviously Congress would only use the word State with a capital S, since if a corporation’s principal place of business was a foreign state it would have no effect whatsoever on its citizenship for diversity purposes in the courts of the United States.

In Steinbock-Sinclair an Illinois resident brought suit against a multinational corporation, which had been incorporated in Delaware. Plaintiffs contend that Steinbock-Sinclair stands for the proposition that a domestic corporation may have a foreign principal place of business for diversity jurisdiction purposes. The stated issue before the district court in Steinbock-Sinclair, however, was “whether or not the defendant has its principal place of business in Illinois.” 401 F.Supp. at 26.

It charged instead that, before the jurors could find the defendant guilty of bank fraud-as charged in Count 4 of the indictment, they must find that, in doing the kiting, defendant was executing or attempting to execute a scheme or artifice to defraud one or both of the banks. The court then discussed the essential elements of a scheme to defraud, including the Government’s burden of negating defendant’s claim of good faith.

The first ground seems to repeat Jones’ arguments on detrimental reliance, which we rejected in our discussion of USA’s common law fraud claim. See supra at 315-16. Because we agree with Jones that USA has failed to plead a pattern of predicate activity, however, we grant Jones’ motion to dismiss USA’s RICO claim. To state a claim under RICO, a complaint must allege: (1) that the defendant (2) through the commission of two or more acts (3) constituting a “pattern” (4) of “racketeering activity” (5) directly or indirectly invests in, or maintains an interest in, or participates in (6) an “enterprise” (7) the activities of which affect interstate commerce.

In its most recent pronouncement on RICO’s pattern requirement, the Supreme Court wrote: In our view, Congress had a more natural and common-sense approach to RICO’s pattern element in mind, intending a more stringent requirement than proof simply of two predicates, but also envisioning a concept of sufficient breadth that it might encompass multiple predicates within a single scheme that were related and that amounted to, or threatened the continued likelihood of, continued criminal activity.

"procedures do not include an award of money. Those courts that have allowed a money damages claim to defeat the exhaustion requirement have not paid the requisite close attention to the statutory language in the current version of the PLRA, the prior version of the PLRA, or the purpose of Congress in enacting the PLRA. Thus, the Court finds that the PLRA requires exhaustion of a prisoner’s claims seeldng monetary damages, injunctive remedies, or both. The exhaustion requirement has been held to be either a jurisdictional requirement or simply a threshold requirement, akin to a statute of limitations. See, e.g. Alexander v.

"thus attaining “market penetration” for Chrysler. The wholesale profits that would thereby be generated would outweigh the losses Chrysler would sustain at the retail level. Chrysler did not manage Van Ness with the specific intent to so “squeeze” Sunset, the argument concludes, but its deliberate overemphasis on wholesale sales, through the unreasonable operation of Van Ness, led inevitably to an impossible competitive situation and the consequent demise of Sunset. It may well be that the predominant emphasis on market penetration, which results in the deliberately reckless operation of a subsidized retailer and which has the inevitable effect of forcing competing and non-subsidized dealers to function at an unprofitable level, could, if proved, constitute an unreasonable restraint of trade. See  REDACTED cf. Industrial Building Materials, Inc. v. Interchemical Corp., 437 F.2d 1336, 1341-1343 (9th Cir. 1970). For purposes of this appeal, that will be assumed.

The charge of possession of a weapon illegally transferred to the possessor is substantially equal to charge of illegal receipt, just as the charge of possession of an unregistered weapon in Haynes was substantially equal to a charge of failure to register, since the responsibility for compliance in both cases is On the accused as possessor. Completion of the order form would have revealed that Weyer possessed a firearm illegally under state law. The statutory scheme violated Weyer’s self-incrimination privilege.

"Bill Hoyt, both Commissioners on the Livingston County Commission, and defendant John Hutcherson, a member of the Grand River Township Board, conspired with each other and with the other named defendants to deprive plaintiff of his civil rights. Since movants are alleged to have acted in concert with these state actors, their actions are cloaked under color of state law. Movants also argue that plaintiff has plead a § 1983 conspiracy with insufficient specificity and that the claim should therefore be dismissed. In discussing the specificity required to sustain a § 1983 conspiracy claim, the Eighth Circuit has stated: The factual basis need not be extensive, but it must be enough to avoid a finding that the suit is frivolous. See  REDACTED Appellants must at least allege that “the defendants had directed themselves toward an unconstitutional action by virtue of a mutual understanding,” and provide some facts “suggesting such a meeting of the minds.” Smith v.

"OPINION NIEMEYER, Circuit Judge: Bell Arthur Water Corporation, a provider of water service to rural areas in Pitt County, North Carolina, seeks protection under § 306(b) of the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act, 7 U.S.C. § 1926(b), against the competitive actions of the City of Greenville and the Greenville Utilities Commission. The City annexed an area known as Ironwood, which Bell Arthur claims was in its service area, and the Commission began providing water service to the area. The district court ruled that Bell Arthur did not meet two threshold requirements of § 1926(b) and therefore was not entitled to its protection.  REDACTED Agreeing with the district court on the absence of one of the statutory requirements, we affirm.

"on notice of what violation of State law plaintiff is complaining [of]....”) The court refused to dismiss counts one and two, however, holding that the qualified-immunity defense was inapplicable as to them because the facts there alleged, if true, would have constituted violations of “a. clearly established constitutional right of which a reasonable person would have known.” The defendants have perfected an interlocutory appeal from the denial of their motion for summary judgment on the first two counts. II Because this appeal was taken from the denial of a motion raising the defense of qualified immunity, we have jurisdiction under the rule of Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U.S. 511, 105 S.Ct. 2806, 86 L.Ed.2d 411 (1985), as interpreted in  REDACTED  cert. denied, - U.S. -, 107 S.Ct. 1334, 94 L.Ed.2d 185 (1987). As a preliminary matter it behooves us to determine whether these defendants are being sued for “discretionary” acts as opposed to “ministerial” ones. Only officials “performing discretionary, as opposed to ministerial, functions are entitled to qualified immunity from suit.” People of Three Mile Island v. Nuclear Regulatory Commissioners, 747 F.2d 139, 143 (3d Cir.1984). The Michigan Supreme Court recently explained the distinction as follows: “ ‘Discretionary-decisional’ acts are those which involve significant decision-making that entails personal deliberation, decision and judgment. ‘Ministerial-operational’ acts involve the execution or implementation of a decision and entail only minor decision-making.” Ross v.

"section 221 of the General Corporation Law of the State of New York. We are convinced that pending final dissolution the same method of accounting for income to such company was followed subsequent to July 23, 1917, as was used prior to that time, namely, the accrual basis. Under all revenue acts which have been enacted since the adoption of the sixteenth amendment, a return of income has been required on an annual basis, showing the result of transactions occurring during a fixed accounting period, either calendar year or fiscal year, at the option of the taxpayer. Under the statutes and regulations in force for 1917 and 1918, a taxpayer could report his income on the accrual basis.  REDACTED The Schoellkopf Company was on a calendar-year basis and reported its income under the accrual method of accounting. The only question in this case, therefore, is whether the controverted item in question accrued in 1917. In other words, was the 1917 sale a transaction from which gain or loss could be said to have accrued in 1917? We have no doubt that it was. An item accrues when all events have occurred necessary to fix the liabilities of the parties concerned therewith and to determine the amount of such liabilities. United States v.

It is therefore important that the trier of fact hear [defendant’s] testimony in order to assess his credibility, and that [plaintiffs] counsel be permitted to explore the doctor’s motivation on cross-examination.” Id. at 69. The difference between situations presenting issues of triable fact and those warranting summary judgment is often a matter of degree.

Under the “state-created danger” theory of liability, a duty to protect emerges after the state affirmatively places an individual in a position of danger that the individual would not otherwise have faced. See, e.g., Greer v. Shoop, 141 F.3d 824, 827-28 (8th Cir.1998); Gregory v.

Accordingly, the new defendants may be estopped from asserting that the Amended Complaint does not relate back under Rule 15(c)(3). B. PERSONAL INVOLVEMENT Defendant, Officer Carbonell, argues that he was not personally involved in any of the allegations averred in Count II of the Amended Complaint. Personal involvement in the alleged wrongs is a prerequisite to imposing liability under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. See, e.g.,  REDACTED Rode v.

On remand, we suggest that the district court consider the following issues when addressing loss causation. First, what effect, if any, did the passage of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (“PSLRA”), 15 U.S.C. § 78u-4, have on this circuit’s loss causation precedent, as articulated in cases like Bruschi v.

Second, does § 78u-4(b)(4) of the PSLRA change the traditional notice pleading standards for the now-codified element of loss causation? See, e.g., Gebhardt v. ConAgra Foods, Inc., 335 F.3d 824, 830 n. 3 (8th Cir.2003) (the PSLRA does not change the traditional pleading rules for materiality and loss causation); Coates v.

"duty to reimburse on either a liability insurance carrier or a no-fault insurance carrier simply because the insurer issues those types of policies to other insureds; rather, I read the statute as applying to the particular carrier who has issued a specific policy to an individual who is both an “insured” under such policy and is also simultaneously “a covered beneficiaiy” entitled to medical care in a military facility as contemplated by § 1095. The right of reimbursement, if any, in favor of the government is dependent upon the terms and provisions of a particular policy. . In some circumstances, the government can also recover under state law as a third-party beneficiary to the insurance contract. See, e.g.,  REDACTED This is separate from the FMCRA and § 1095.

"required to award plaintiffs from defendants or Mr. Barnes as a direct result of the violations. At an hourly rate. of$120.00, which defendants have not contested, the total award of attorney’s fees based on recorded hours is $7,026.00. Although plaintiffs seek an award for additional unrecorded hours and costs, this court is reluctant to do so without supporting documentation. Plaintiffs also seek additional damages, presumably under the rubric of “reasonable expenses.” This court interprets “reasonable expenses” to mean only the actual costs incurred as a result of the misconduct, and not to include consequential damages. Even FRCP 11 does not authorize an award of consequential damages, even though one of its main objectives is deterrence. See  REDACTED  rev’d in part on other grounds, 892 F.2d 802 (9th Cir.1989), aff'd 498 U.S. 533, 111 S.Ct. 922, 112 L.Ed.2d 1140 (1991) (Supreme Court approvingly noted the district court’s refusal to award consequential damages under FRCP 11). Therefore, it is not appropriate under FRCP 37 to require defendants to pay any amount other than plaintiffs’ actual attorney’s fees and costs incurred. Although plaintiffs have not requested an allocation of the sanctions between defendants or their attorney, FRCP 37 contemplates that the burden will fall on the individual responsible for the offending conduct.

See 29 U.S.C. § 794a(a)(l). These procedures require a plaintiff to exhaust his/her administrative remedies before the EEOC before seeking relief in court. Accordingly, plaintiff must initially file an administrative claim with the EEOC that sets forth with specificity the theory behind the charge being made before filing in federal court. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e — 5(f)(1); Alfred v. Scribner Hall & Thompson, LLP, 473 F.Supp.2d 6, 8 (D.D.C.2007); see  REDACTED Indeed, the EEOC administrative charging document has boxes to check that specify the plaintiffs theory behind the discrimination charge. It should be noted, however, that while a Title VII suit is normally limited in scope to the allegations of the EEOC charge, the rule is not absolute. If a complainant brings a retaliation claim that was not included in the original administrative charges but the retaliation claim is “ ‘like or reasonably related to the allegations of the charge and growing out of such allegations,’ ” courts have not required the complainant to first exhaust his administrative remedies.

See  REDACTED In re Warner, 87 B.R. 199, 202 (Bankr.M.D.Fla.1988). Badges of fraud include: (1) a relationship between the debtor and the transferee; (2) lack of consideration for the conveyance; (3) insolvency or indebtedness of the debtor; (4) the transfer of the debtor’s entire estate; (5) reservation of benefits, control or dominion by the debt- or; (6) secrecy or concealment of the transaction; and (7) pendency or threat of litigation at the time of the transfer.

Lake Charles American Press, L.L.C. , 566 F.3d 164 (5th Cir. 2009). See Vu v. Vu , No. H-16-0366, 2016 WL 3181168, at *4-*5 (S.D. Tex.

As to the cases cited by the defendants that provided no discussion of the TCPA's applicability in federal court, the court is unpersuaded.

The court is similarly unconvinced by the decisions cited by the defendants that applied the TCPA based on the Fifth Circuit's decision in Henry .

The existing case law regarding whether Appellees were seized for the purposes of the Fourth Amendment is far from settled, as evidenced by the varying decisions from our sister circuits analyzing similar situations. Compare Childress v. City of Arapaho, 210 F.3d 1154 (10th Cir.2000) (no seizure), Schaefer v. Goch, 153 F.3d 793 (7th Cir.1998) (no seizure), Medeiros v.

Again, I disagree. The question presented is not whether, on some occasions, a particular vehicle or vehicles were driven in interstate commerce, but whether the road testing associated with the position of mechanic constituted driving in interstate commerce.

In cases involving abortion, as in cases involving the right to travel or the right to marry, the identification of the constitutionally protected interest is merely the beginning of the analysis. State regulation of travel and of marriage is obviously permissible even though a State may not categorically exclude nonresidents from its borders, Shapiro v. Thompson, 394 U.

Even if we were to consider defendant’s contention, we find it without merit. Although it may be improper for a judge to charge a jury on the defendant’s failure to take the stand where the defendant has expressly requested that such a charge not be given, (See Caton v. United States, 407 F.2d 367 (8th Cir. 1969), the courts have unanimously held that where no such request is made, it is not reversible error for the trial judge to extend such an instruction sua sponte.

The rationale for this rule is that, as a part of trial strategy, the defendant ought to be permitted to have nothing said on the issue if he makes his desire known before the charge.

DiPaulo, 295 F.3d 137, 142 (1st Cir.2002).

The court’s task is to determine “whether the acts about which an employee complains are part of the same actionable hostile work environment practice, and if so, whether any act falls within the statutory time period.” Morgan, 536 U.S. at 120, 122 S.Ct. 2061. In contrast to a claim alleging a hostile work environment, the continuing violation doctrine does not apply to a claim based on discrete discriminatory acts. See Pegram, 361 F.3d at 279; Celestine, 266 F.3d at 352; Huckabay, 142 F.3d at 239. “The doctrine ‘“requires",474856

Conversely , the Debtor argues that these contracts are executory due to the Debtor’s continuing obligation not to compete, the continuing duty to provide insurance, and the continuing duty to comply with various environmental laws. Additionally, the Debtor argues that rejection of the contracts constitutes sound business judgment as would allow the Debtor to pay claimants 100% of their allowed claims. DISCUSSION I. Bad Faith While not stated explicitly in Section 1112(b) of the Bankruptcy Code, courts have held that petitions filed in bad faith may be dismissed for cause. See, e.g.,  REDACTED In re Phoenix Piccadilly, Ltd., 849 F.2d 1393, 1394 (11th Cir.1988). In determining whether a Chapter 11 petition was filed in bad faith, courts look to the totality of the circumstances surrounding the debtor’s filing. Carolin Corp. v. Miller, 886 F.2d 693, 701 (4th Cir.1989). In this district, Judge Barta, following several recent decisions in other jurisdictions, listed the following factors as indicative of whether a debtor has filed in bad faith: (a) whether the debtor owns but one primary asset, which asset is encumbered by a secured creditor’s lien; (b) whether the debtor employs an insignificant number of non-insider employees; (c) whether the debtor generates insignificant cash flow; (d) whether the debtor lacks available sources of income to sustain",813273
"whether the lack of federal jurisdiction appears from the face of the pleading itself. Thornhill Publ’g Co. v. General Tel. Elec., 594 F.2d 730, 733 (9th Cir.1979); Mortensen v. First Fed. Sav. & Loan Ass’n, 549 F.2d 884, 891 (3d Cir.1977); Cervantez v. Sullivan, 719 F.Supp. 899, 903 (E.D.Cal.1989), rev’d on other grounds, 963 F.2d 229 (9th Cir.1992). A defendant may also attack the existence of subject matter jurisdiction apart from the pleadings. Mortensen, 549 F.2d at 891. In such a case, the court may rely on evidence extrinsic to the pleadings and resolve factual disputes relating to jurisdiction. St. Clair v. City of Chico, 880 F.2d 199, 201 (9th Cir.1989); Roberts v. Corrothers, 812 F.2d 1173, 1177 (9th Cir.1987);  REDACTED DISCUSSION A. Service Rule 12(b)(5) allows a defendant to move to dismiss an action where the service of process of a summons and complaint is insufficient. Under Rule 4(i), a party seeking to serve the United States must serve a copy of the summons and complaint (1) personally on the United States Attorney for the district in which the action is brought and (2) by certified or registered mail to the United States Attorney General. Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(i); McGuckin v. United States, 918 F.2d 811, 813 (9th Cir.1990).

"McWILLIAMS, Circuit Judge. Lawrence Schreiber, plaintiff-appellant, appeals the summary judgment entered in favor of Allis-Chalmers, the defendant-appellee. The Memorandum and Order of the trial court now appears as  REDACTED Schreiber filed the instant action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi, Jackson Division, on June 16, 1977. Allis-Chalmers, the defendant, is incorporated in Delaware, and has its headquarters in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Since 1932 Allis-Chalmers has been duly licensed, qualified and authorized to do business in the State of Mississippi. Service of process was made by serving Allis-Chalmers’ statutory agent for service of process. Additionally, the general manager of Allis-Chalmers’ manufacturing facility, located just south of Jackson, Mississippi, was personally served with process.

He also argues that the ALJ had a duty to seek clarification before giving his doctor’s opinion little or no weight. Because the opinion of his treating physician was contradicted by other medical evidence based on personal examination of Nall, the ALJ did not err in giving the opinion little or no weight without seeking clarification.

Hughes, 38 F.R.D. 499 (S.D.N.Y.1965). Thus, our starting point in assessing damages in this case is necessarily the assumption that the defendants did conduct a racially discriminatory policy of employment within the prison to the detriment of the plaintiff. This Circuit has recognized three types of damages which may be recovered under appropriate circumstances for a violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Besides actual compensatory damages, the successful plaintiff may recover nominal damages which flow from the deprivation of valuable constitutional rights, as well as punitive damages.  REDACTED Washington v. Official Court Stenographer, 251 F.Supp. 945 (E.D.Pa.1966). We make the following findings of fact based on plaintiff’s testimony and his cumulative adjustment and work and quarters assignment record as compiled by Graterford personnel. Shortly after being returned to Graterford from Philadelphia, plaintiff on July 26, 1966 was transferred from his 69 cents a day job as a press operator in the prison’s weave shop to a position as a cleaner in E-Block at 15 cents a day. The court rejects plaintiff’s contention as speculation that had he remained employed in the weave shop, he would have been promoted after a period of some months to a much higher paying job in that shop as a towel machine operator.",110226

In particular, even assuming there is some outer limit on a district court’s discretion to revisit evidentiary rulings, it is clear that pre-trial evidentiary rulings may be revisited were no prejudice accrues to the party that had previously thought it had secured a favorable ruling from the district court. See United States v.

Here, though Wade makes vague reference on appeal to the fact that his strategy during plea negotiations or trial was influenced by the district court's pre-trial ruling regarding Mayhook’s testimony, there is nothing in the record that shows how Wade could have been actually prejudiced in a way that was related specifically to the district court's reversal of course.

"tenancy by the entirety. The Trustee estimates that this would be approximately $50,000, an amount sufficient to cover Debtor’s obligations and still leave him with enough money for a “fresh start.” Accordingly, the Trustee reasoned that Debtor acted in bad faith in filing his petition knowing that he would soon be in a position to repay his debts. The bankruptcy court found that Debtor had failed to prove his good faith in filing for bankruptcy and dismissed the Debtor’s petition under Section 707(a). The district court affirmed. DISCUSSION Section 707(a) allows a bankruptcy court to dismiss a petition for cause if the petitioner fails to demonstrate his good faith in filing. See In re Zick, 931 F.2d 1124, 1126-27 (6th Cir.1991),  REDACTED Although the Code does not define “good faith,” courts in this circuit have uniformly held that “[a]t the very least, good faith requires a showing of honest intention.” See Marks, 174 B.R. at 40. Courts have cautioned, however, that: Dismissal based on lack of good faith ... should be confined carefully and is generally utilized only in those egregious cases that entail concealed or misrepresented assets and/or sources of income, lavish lifestyles, and intention to avoid a large single debt based upon conduct akin to fraud, misconduct or gross negligence.

"""Muha dictum about the substantial association prong — that is, that straightforward exclusivity is required. .Typically, franchisees threatened with severe economic harm arising from termination bring suit under the CFA without delay and seek immediate injunctive relief.

One month later, Weisberg filed an additional—and very broad—administrative request for further information bearing on Dr. King’s murder. The second request sought virtually all information in the FBI’s files pertaining to the investigation. The next day, without waiting the statutory (ten-day) period, see 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(6)(A)(i), Weisberg amended his complaint to include (anticipated) non-disclosure under his second administrative request.

Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 249, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 2511, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). In sum, when reviewing this motion for summary judgment by Hercules, this Court (1) resolves conflicting evidence in favor of plaintiff, (2) does not engage in credibility determinations, and (3) draws all reasonable inferences in favor of plaintiff.

Id., at n. 7. Although Tuttle does not directly answer the situation presented in this action, it does express a requirement for greater proof where the policy alleged is not itself unconstitutional. Since Tuttle, several courts have considered cases where the Plaintiff has alleged a policy of inadequate training. See, e.g., Rymer v. Davis, 775 F.2d 389 (6th Cir.1985); Gilmere v.

In reaffirming its earlier decision at 754 F.2d 198, the court noted that it had not relied on a single incident.

"But, that remedy is limited to cases involving an “individual” debtor who is injured by a willful violation of the stay. 11 U.S.C. § 362(h). Because of this limiting factor, some courts have held that there is no remedy available for a corporate debtor that has suffered injury because of a stay violation. In re Chateaugay Corp., 920 F.2d 183 (2d Cir.1990). If that case, and others like it, are correct, then it is difficult to extrapolate a remedy for a violation of the statutory stay under section 524. Notwithstanding the limiting language of section 362(h), other courts have fashioned an implied remedy under section 105 of the Code. In re Skinner, 917 F.2d 444 (10th Cir.1990);  REDACTED This Court believes that this is clearly the better view and that the same reasoning applies when section 524(a) has been violated. The Court adopts the reasoning of the court in Molloy v. Primus Automotive Financial Services, 247 B.R. 804, 816-20 (C.D.Cal.2000), finding that section 524 carries with it an “implied private right of action.” The question, then, is whether the Plaintiffs have established a claim that may give rise to a remedy.

If, on the other hand, Canfina had obtained the stock in satisfaction of the Alford debt, then Canfina had changed the board and the new board had not authorized the filing. This dispute over the ownership of the Cadiz stock may ultimately rebut the presumption, but the dispute cannot be resolved in a contested matter under Bankruptcy Rule 9014. The determination of the ownership of the stock must be resolved in an adversary proceeding. Bankruptcy Rules 7001(2) and (9).

"SMITH, Senior Circuit Judge. Thomas A. Demko and Penn Arms, Inc., appeal from the decision of the Court of Federal Claims denying their motion for summary judgment and granting the United States’ cross-motion for summary judgment. Specifically, the court held that the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (“ATF”) had the authority to classify the Striker-12 shotgun as a “destructive device” as defined in 26 U.S.C §§ 5845(a)(8), (f)(2) (1994), and thus subject to a $200.00 transfer tax pursuant to 26 U.S.C. § 5811 (1994). See  REDACTED Because the Court of Federal Claims correctly found that the ATF had the authority to classify the Striker-12 shotgun as a “destructive device” within the meaning of the statute, we affirm. Issues The two issues addressed in this appeal are (1) whether the CFC erred in holding that the ATF had the authority to classify the Striker-12 shotgun as a “destructive device”; and (2) whether the CFC correctly held that the standard “generally recognized as particularly suitable for sporting purposes” contained in 26 U.S.C. § 5845(f)(2) is a constitutional delegation of legislative power. Background The National Firearms Act (“NFA”) provides for the taxation of manufacturers, importers and dealers in certain firearms and machine guns. See 26 U.S.C. §§ 5812, 5822, 5841, 5845(a)(8),",384739

Bartle, 871 F.2d 331, 347 (3d Cir.1989) (“It is axiomatic that violations of state law alone are insufficient to state a claim for section 1983 relief’) (citations omitted). 2. Fourteenth Amendment Claim Based Upon Defendants’ Alleged Failure To Train Prison Officer's In Suicide Prevention Were the Court to find that the defendants did have actual or constructive knowledge of the decedent’s suicidal intent, or followed a custom or policy that insufficiently met the serious medical needs of suicidal detainees, plaintiff would still have to raise a factual dispute over the question whether the municipal custom can be said to have caused Herman’s death. In  REDACTED  the Supreme Court held that there are limited circumstances in which a municipality can be subject to § 1983 liability for its deliberate failure to train its employees, when such failure results in injury to an individual’s constitutional rights. In such cases, the municipality’s failure to train “amounts to deliberate indifference to the rights of persons within whom the police come into contact.” Id. at 388, 109 S.Ct. at 1204. In her brief opposing defendants’ motions for summary judgment, plaintiff states that she “is not claiming against [the Clearfield County] defendants that their unconstitutional policy or failure to train caused a violation of decedent’s right.” Plaintiffs Brief in Opposition to the Clearfield County Defendants’ Motion for",433746
"Court on Mr. Ypsilantes’ Motion to Quash. It is true that this amendment made it clear that “housekeeping” regulations promulgated under section 301 did not, of themselves, create a privilege against disclosure of information under the Freedom of Information Act. See Marcoux v. Mid-States Livestock, 66 F.R.D. 573, 576 (W.D.Mo. 1975). What the amendment did not do, however, is alter the long-established rule that a superior government official could withdraw from his subordinates the power to release government documents. In this respect, the Supreme Court’s holdings in Boske and Touhy remain the controlling law. The United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit has recognized the continuing vitality of Boske and Touhy in several post-1958 cases. In United States Steel  REDACTED 980), the Tenth Circuit reversed a District Court order compelling enforcement of a subpoena against an employee of the United States Bureau of Standards. The Court based its reversal on Touhy. United States Steel Corporation, 663 F.2d at 68. In Saunders v. Great Western Sugar Company, 396 F.2d 794 (10th Cir.1968), the Tenth Circuit reviewed a “housekeeping” regulation promulgated by the Small Business Administration similar in impact to the regulation before this Court. While noting that a requirement that the litigants proceed against the proper SBA official in the District of Columbia might prove a hardship, the Court in Saunders nevertheless held that it was “bound by Touhy and Boske.” Saunders, 396 F.2d at 795. Other courts have relied on Touhy to",55595
"very rapidly and that in his opinion the symptoms observed in 1920 were the beginning of the condition found in 1921. Under such circumstances, a finding of total and permanent disability in July, 1919, was not justified, even though insured may have had incipient tuberculosis at that time; and verdict should have been directed for the government. Ivey v.  REDACTED The principles applicable were thus stated in the Eggen Case by the Circuit Court of Appeals of the Eighth Circuit in a passage which we quoted with approval in the Stack Case: “Courts recognize the fact that tuberculosis in its incipient stage is usually not an incurable malady. See Nicolay v. United States [(C. C. A.) 51 F.(2d) 170], supra; Hirt v. United States [(C. C. A.) 56 F.(2d) 80], supra. A finding that the insured was permanently disabled on October 1, 1919, or prior thereto, would not only be without substantial support in the evidence, but would necessarily be based solely upon speculation and conjecture, No one could determine from the evidence whether there were, during the life of the policy,",137806
"cocaine, Class I felonies under North Carolina law, and Watkins’ conviction was for possession with intent to sell cocaine, a Class H felony. At the time of each of these state convictions, Evans’ pri- or record level was not above IV and Watkins’ prior record level was II; the sentencing court in each case found that Evans and Watkins should be sentenced within the presumptive range of the applicable sentencing table under N.C. Gen. Stat. § 15A-1340.17(c) (2007). Under North Carolina law, both Evans and Watkins faced maximum terms of imprisonment of ten months. See N.C. Gen.Stat. § 15A-1340.17(d) (2007). Therefore, neither Evans nor Watkins could have received a term of imprisonment exceeding twelve months for their prior convictions. In  REDACTED  we determined that a prior offense is not punishable by a term exceeding one year of imprisonment if the defendant could not have actually received more than one year of imprisonment for that offense, based on his prior criminal history and other factors. As Evans could not have received a term exceeding one year of imprisonment for either of the two challenged prior state offenses, he only had one qualifying predicate offense under § 841(b)(1)(A), not two or more. Because the advisory Guidelines range was determined based on the statutory mandatory minimum of life imprisonment rather than twenty years of imprisonment, see U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual § 5G1.1 (2010), Evans was sentenced based on an incorrect Guidelines calculation and",207607
"that the phrase “satisfactory assurances” is entirely subjective and therefore involves a judgment committed to agency discretion by law, and not subject to judicial review. But see Citizens to Preserve Overton Park v. Volpe, 401 U.S. 402, 91 S.Ct. 814, 28 L.Ed.2d 136 (1971). To support its argument defendants cite the court to several cases interpreting similar words as used in other statutes. But the cases cited by defendants are based upon federal statutes which contain common provisions critical to those decisions, and not present in this case. In each case cited by the defendants the applicable federal statute expressly required that the assurances be given to a specified public official to whom those assurances must be satisfactory. For example, in  REDACTED .Tenn.1973), an environmental group was attempting to enjoin a channelization project by the Corps of Engineers. The plaintiff there argued that local agencies had not given satisfactory assurances to supply support for the project. However, the applicable federal statute, 33 U.S.C. § 701c, provided that no money could be expended by the federal agency on that particular project until the local agencies had “given assurances satisfactory to the Secretary of the Army . . ..” (Emphasis added). The statutory language in the instant case is not so definitive or restrictive. The phrase “satisfactory assurances,” as used in § 80(b), is used in a general, nonspecific sense and vests no particular public official with the authority to make a determination of precisely what degree",880230
"Deputy Commissioner on December 24, 1941. The employer filed an application for review and after further hearing on January 19, 1942, the Deputy Commissioner, on January 27, 1942, filed an opinion affirming his earlier finding and ordered the application for review be rejected “on the ground that no mistake in the finding of fact was made in the previous order.” At the hearing on January 19, 1942 testimony was taken of a physician who had treated Glover in the hospital. In my opinion the motion to dismiss must be granted. This Court is not a fact-finding body in compensation cases. It is true that the Longshoremen’s and Harbor Workers’ Compensation Act, 33 U.S.C.A. § 901 et seq., has been construed, in  REDACTED ntal and jurisdictional issues; but since no such application has been made in this case, the duty of the District Court is limited to determining whether the findings of the Deputy Commissioner are supported by the evidence.

"Matthews’s sufficiency of the evidence challenge is, therefore, without merit. V. Finally, we turn to Matthews’s claim that the district court erred by admitting Rule 404(b) testimony regarding his 1991 arrest. Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b) provides in relevant part that [ejvidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident .... This circuit’s test for admissibility of 404(b) evidence was announced in United States v. Beechum, 582 F.2d 898 (5th Cir. 1978) (en banc), and later elaborated upon in  REDACTED Second, the act must be established by sufficient proof to permit a jury finding that the defendant committed the extrinsic act; Third, the probative value of the evidence must not be substantially outweighed by its undue prejudice, and the evidence must meet the other requirements of Rule 403. United States v. Delgado, 56 F.3d 1357, 1365 (11th Cir.1995). The district court’s decision to admit or exclude such evidence is reviewed for abuse of discretion. Id. at 1363. In United States v.

Notably, the court cannot ground its order upon the authority of 5 U.S.C. § 6322. By its terms, the statute mandates leave only for the period of time during which a government employee """"is summoned, in connection with a judicial proceeding.” 5 U.S.C. § 6322(a). This statutory mandate is limited to involuntary appearances and does not extend to time spent in voluntary pretrial preparation. See, e.g.,  REDACTED Shelborne v.

Both Shelborne and Moore sought to narrow the appropriate circumstances for ordering paid leave for case preparation by limiting Mitchell's application to the “tested” litigant. See Moore, 113 F.Supp.2d at 29 (concluding that its plaintiffs were not entitled to paid leave for case preparation because they were """"still in the early stages of the litigation,” while """"Mitchell's case had already been tried and appealed, so that Mitchell was not 'an untested litigant’ ”); Shelborne, 1997 WL 527352, at *16""",7205

"of the issue absent the restrictions that the “contrary to or unreasonable application” standard may impose. See Clinkscale, 375 F.3d at 436. Nevertheless, it is still difficult to show that a lengthy prison sentence violates the Eighth Amendment. A plurality of the Supreme Court has held that the Eighth Amendment does not require strict proportionality between the crime and sentence. See Harmelin, 501 U.S. at 965, 111 S.Ct. 2680. As the Supreme Court observed in Lockyer, it is generally recognized after Harmelin that the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause of the Eighth Amendment forbids only an extreme disparity between crime and sentence, that is, sentences that are “grossly disproportionate” to the crime. Id. at 1001, 111 S.Ct. 2680 (Kennedy, J., concurring);  REDACTED Georgia, 433 U.S. 584, 592, 97 S.Ct. 2861, 53 L.Ed.2d 982 (1977)); United States v.

"the Chicago ordinance as a whole affects the right does not trigger compelling state interest analysis of the ordinance. Plaintiffs strongest argument in favor of compelling state interest review here is that the ordinance disadvantages new residents of Chicago and that this classification is suspect because it depends upon residence and implicates the federally protected right to travel. Plaintiff correctly asserts that courts have in some cases applied a heightened level of scrutiny where the state has created rights and limited their availability to individuals depending in part upon the duration of their residence.

In other words, the fact that a party was permitted to participate in bankruptcy-court proceedings does not mean that the party necessarily has standing to appeal orders entered in those proceedings. “ ‘Person aggrieved’ is, of course, a term of art: almost by definition, all appellants may claim in some way to be ‘aggrieved,’ else they would not bother to prosecute their appeals.”  REDACTED To qualify as a “person aggrieved,” an appellant must have a “financial stake in the bankruptcy court’s order, meaning [it was] directly and adversely affected pecuniarily by the order.” In re Peoples, 764 F.3d 817, 820 (8th Cir.2014) (citation and quotations omitted).

Indeed, decisions under the FLSA hold that the Secretary of Transportation has the power to set maximum hours for drivers if the company engages in more than de minimi interstate commerce which includes a company that holds itself out as an interstate company and solicits that business even though its prospect of obtaining such business is poor and some of its drivers never drive in interstate commerce. See  REDACTED Morris v. McComb, 332 U.S. 422, 68 S.Ct. 131, 92 L.Ed. 44 (1947). However, the Secretary of Transportation does not have jurisdiction over all drivers of an interstate carrier.

The government, however, argues that section 5908 cannot “relat[e] to” patents because it is concerned solely with title, ownership, and assignment issues which are merely contract issues over which this court lacks exclusive jurisdiction.

The Government contends these review standards do not apply because Dartez did not make a contemporaneous objection to the sentence imposed. If that is so, our review would be for plain error. It is not necessary to determine the sufficiency of Dartez’s 'objection at his sentencing hearing because he has failed to show that his sentence is infirm even under an abuse of discretion standard. Dartez’s first argument is that the district court’s determination about the number of images was the type of clearly erroneous fact-finding that amounts to procedural error. See  REDACTED However, Dartez offered no evidence in rebuttal to the Government’s witness. There is thus nothing to show that the district court’s factual finding was erroneous. See United States v.

Because the permanent injunction goes further than appears to have been necessary to achieve this purpose, however, we remand the case for further consideration of the breadth of the injunction and of whether the school board should be allowed to consider solutions to the problems of interference with the plan of desegregation short of the total and permanent ban of the symbols required by the court’s injunction. The facts of this case and the district court’s reasoning are ably set forth in the opinion reported as  REDACTED This presents but one facet of an original action filed in 1960 to require that the schools of Escambia County be reorganized into a unitary system operated on a nonracial basis. The court retained jurisdiction of the matter in order to effectuate its orders, and has continued to exercise supervision under its retained jurisdiction, as required by the law of this Circuit. During the 1972-1973 school year, the fourth year of significant integration, Escambia High was afflicted with racial •'disturbances within the student body, slightly less than eight percent of which was black.

"However, these factors alone do not render force used against him unreasonable per se. In fact, we need not look far for proof that even a young child is capable of physical violence — C.G.H. had been physically combative towards the school employees prior to Albrand’s arrival, requiring the efforts of three individuals to restrain him. Indeed, it is with alarming frequency that we are confronted with stories in the news of acts of violence at the hands of minors. An arrestee’s age and small demeanor do not necessarily undermine an officer’s concern for safety and need to control the situation. The cases relied on by the Hawkers are inapposite. See Morris v. Noe, 672 F.3d 1185 (10th Cir.2012);  REDACTED Each involved the use of force on an individual posing no immediate threat to the officer. Morris, 672 F.3d at 1196 (forceful “throw down” of non-resisting unarmed individual); Novitsky, 491 F.3d at 1255 (use of twist-lock maneuver on non-resisting individual lying in fetal position in parked car during a welfare check). Here, in contrast, C.G.H grabbed Albrand’s arm, an action a reasonable officer could objectively view as an act of violent resistance. The facts in this case are unfortunate in all respects. It is regrettable that a police officer feels a need to resort to physical force, handcuffs, and arrest in order to gain control of and reason with a nine-year-old child. Equally regrettable is the disrespectful, obdurate, and combative behavior",51148
"the undisputed facts show that he started at a lower nominal salary as a full-time employee compared with the salary Kienzle had in the same job while paid on a part-time basis. However, GM does not dispute that Kienzle’s salary was discounted based on her part-time status; indeed GM points out that when Kienzle was upgraded from 24 hours per week to 32 hours per week she received a proportional 33% raise. If GM paid Kienzle less because she was classified as part-time than it would have had she been full-time, that suffices to show a pay disparity, even if her net salary in dollar terms was higher than some other employees paid on a full-time basis.  REDACTED  illustrates the point. In that case, the court found that the plaintiff had established a prima facie case under the EPA where she showed that a school district imposed a lower annual pro rata salary cap on her compared with the cap applied to her male predecessor. District administrators had their salaries scaled or capped based on the number of “extended service days” per year that varied according to how each position was rated. The plaintiff was hired with a 220-day cap, but her predecessor had been subject to a 240-day cap, and received a 10% bonus as well. The court did not discuss the dollar figures that the salary formula produced, but treated the lower pro rata cap as evidence",672925
"rights under the statute do not constitute a claim. As a result, they are not discharge-able in this bankruptcy proceeding, nor do they participate with other claims in any bankruptcy distribution. Some of the decisions have come to this result on the ground that the non-debtor spouse’s contingent rights are property interests recognizable in bankruptcy.

Background Debtors Cesar and Ana Flores filed a petition for relief under Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code. They have unsecured debts. They proposed a plan of reorganization under which they would pay $122 per month (1 %) of allowed, unsecured, nonpriority claims for three years. Chapter 13 Trustee Rod Danielson objected to the plan, arguing, as now relevant, that § 1325(b) requires a minimum duration of five years for persons in Debtors’ circumstances. The bankruptcy court sustained the Trustee’s objection, holding that Debtors were not entitled to a shorter plan duration because the Supreme Court’s decision in  REDACTED  is clearly irreconcilable with Kagenveama. The bankruptcy court confirmed a plan of five years’ duration, which provided for monthly payments of $148 to unsecured creditors. Debtors timely appealed to the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel. The bankruptcy court then certified the plan-duration issue for direct appeal to this court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 158(d)(2). A divided panel of this court reversed, reasoning that Lanning is not clearly irreconcilable with Kagenveama and that, under Kagenveama, § 1325(b) allows a shorter plan duration for Debtors.

In support of their Motion to Dismiss, the Defendants insist that James Doe’s punishment for writing, “I just sniffed your crack,” near the crease in a female student’s yearbook did not violate his First Amendment rights, regardless of whether his words were legally obscene or whether they constituted legally actionable sexual harassment. (Doc. # 7 at 6-8). In support, the Defendants rely upon  REDACTED  in which the Supreme Court held that a student could be disciplined for speech that was “sexually explicit,” even if not legally obscene, because the school was entitled to “disassociate itself’ from speech that is “wholly inconsistent with the ‘fundamental values’ of public school education.” Id. at 685-686, 106 S.Ct. 3159.

Substantial evidence also supports the BIA’s denial of CAT relief because Tejada did not establish a likelihood of torture by, at the instigation of, or with the consent or acquiescence of the Honduran government.

We need not decide whether Sutton’s contacts with Texas that are unrelated to this cause would allow article 2031b to reach Sutton under Texas law, however, since the district court properly grounded jurisdiction on those activities implicated in this suit — the out-of-state acts giving rise to Carbide’s alleged injury in Texas. See Bennett Industries, Inc. v. Laher, 557 F.Supp. 965, 966 (N.D.Tex.1983). Jurisdiction over Sutton is not based on the uncontested jurisdiction over UGI and AmeriGas. Rather, Sutton’s personal participation in the actions causally related to Carbide’s alleged injury provides a distinct basis for the assertion of personal jurisdiction over Sutton. See L. C.L.

Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc., 619 F.2d 455, 457 (5th Cir.1980);  REDACTED Sutton’s admitted attendance at the July AmeriGas meeting wherein the $.20/ccf price was reached and his approval of the price causally relate to Carbide’s damages flowing from loss of the Nucor contract under Carbide’s claim of tortious interference. Carbide carried its burden of establishing a prima facie case that appellants committed a tort partially in Texas. See Jetco Electronic Industries, Inc. v. Gardiner, 473 F.2d 1228, 1232 (5th Cir.1973). Carbide alleged that appellants intentionally arrived at a price equal to Carbide’s disinterest price and tortiously induced Nucor to breach its supply contract with Carbide.

In Texas law, a debtor on a secured note has been put to the burden of proving that the foreclosure sale was unreasonable (although some Texas cases have split on this, we need not dwell on that here). See Tarrant Savings Association v. Lucky Homes, Inc., 390 S.W.2d 473, 474, 475 (Tex.1965);  REDACTED Summary judgment was not proper on the foreclosure issue because the record reflects a material fact dispute as to the unreasonableness of the foreclosure sale. Appellees rely heavily on Lanier to convince us no fact dispute exists. We are unconvinced. In Lanier, we broadly noted that under Texas law proof that the price realized at a foreclosure sale was less than the value the debtor could establish for the goods, even if the foreclosure price was below cost, is not alone sufficient to establish that a foreclosure sale was commercially unreasonable. See Lanier, supra, at 467 (citing Pruske v. National Bank of Commerce, 533 S.W.2d 931, 937 (Tex.Civ.App. San Antonio 1976)). We declined “to infer commercial unreasonableness from what might",629639

In addition, the County explained that it decided to fill the sole residential inspector position with Friel instead of Eubanks because he was the more qualified candidate who could better contribute to the Building Department given its reduced size.

Plaintiff also argues that the Treaty characterizes the Canadian revenue claim as an assessment as opposed to a tax, and that under recent Supreme Court precedent it should not be treated as a tax for purposes of the AIA. Both of these arguments require this Court to determine whether this collection is a “tax” for purposes of applying the Anti-Injunction Act. Generally, the Court must interpret the word “tax” in the context of applying the AIA bar the same as it would be defined under a tax refund action. See  REDACTED .C. § 1346(a) and Anti-Injunction and Declaratory Judgment acts). However, in 2012 the Supreme Court in National Federation of Independent Business v.

"to require production of the documents as to which discovery is here sought would conflict with Gay Gibson, supra. The short answer to that is that the brief order in Gibson did not discuss the issue of governmental privilege, independent of executive privilege.

While the order protected intra-agency opinions and conclusions against disclosure, we are not shown that executive privilege was not the basis for the ruling or was not claimed.

"the present case. Id. at 1217. The Sixth Circuit provided that: An action of state or local government which “shocks the conscience” of the federal court, may violate substantive due process. This Court has recently expressed the view that “ ‘[ajpplying the “shock the conscience” test in an area other than excessive force ... is problematic.’ ” The right not to be subject to “arbitrary or capricious” action by a state either by legislative or administrative action is commonly referred to as a “substantive due process right.” Id. (footnotes omitted). Plainitff’s contention that the Sixth Circuit has abandoned the “shocks the conscience” test is defeated by the court’s discussion in Pearson. The Court finds the language quoted by plaintiff from  REDACTED  to explain that the alleged gross negligence and reckless indifference exhibited by the defendant in that case satisfied the two standards later enumerated in Pearson. In any event, however, the conduct complained of in this action is the allegedly arbitrary and capricious treatment of plaintiff by defendants in their refusal to make a decision on his lot split request and in repeatedly requesting more and more information which plaintiff claims is unnecessary to defendants’ determination. To prevail on his “arbitrary and capricious” substantive due process claim, “plaintiff must show that the state administrative agency has been guilty of ‘arbitrary and capricious action’ in the strict sense, meaning ‘that there is no rational basis for the ...

When an expressive action is challenged on the grounds that it is obscene, the communication is subjected to the three part test set forth by the Supreme Court in Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15, 93 S.Ct. 2607, 37 L.Ed.2d 419 (1973):(1) Whether the average person applying community standards would find the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest; (2) Whether the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by applicable state law; and (3) Whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value. The Fifth Circuit has held that this test is conjunctive.  REDACTED Thus, a work cannot be held obscene unless each element of the test has been evaluated independently and all three have been satisfied. Without having to decide whether “gangster rap” appeals to the community’s prurient interest or whether it depicts patently offensive sexual conduct, the Court finds that defendants have not established the third element of the Miller test, that is, the work lacks serious artistic value.

"to a Chapter 13, it follows that only those debts not discharged and/or secured debts are the surviving claims which may be included in a payment plan pursuant to Chapter 13. That is the effect of a discharge. 11 U.S.C. § 524. Conversion under these circumstances clearly presumes that, in fact, there are surviving debts and payment of these obligations needs orderly restructuring under a Chapter 13 plan. The only other possible conclusion a court could reach is that the request to convert in order to pay debts somehow implies that the discharge should be set aside automatically. This conclusion, however, is wholly unsupported by the Code and case authority. The finality of a discharge order must be accorded special consideration.  REDACTED In re Tuan Tan Dihn, 90 B.R. 743, 745 (Bankr.E.D.Pa.1988). Hence, the more logical interpretation is that the debtor intends that only debts surviving the Chapter 7 discharge need be part of the Chapter 13 plan. The Court must presume the debtor in this case wishes to retain her discharge because she does not seek to set it aside and has pre-empted a creditor’s attempt to revoke it with this Motion to Convert. In that case the evidence reveals there are no debts remaining for which she is liable. Her request to convert is meaningless. Finally, the Court notes that the debtor lists income of only $400.00 and expenses equal to this amount. Thus, even if the debtor could get over",209098
"trial or the criminal transaction, or that the juror was a witness or somehow involved in the criminal transaction.” Johnson is not related to the facts or parties of this case in a manner that approaches such an extreme situation. Therefore, the district court did not err in denying Tucker’s new trial motion. We must affirm the district court’s holding that Tucker failed to establish his right to a new trial based on juror misconduct at voir dire. II. Tucker also attacks the district court’s assessment that there was no evidence of improper outside influence over Johnson. We review a district court’s decision on whether to grant a new trial because of outside juror contacts for abuse of discretion. See  REDACTED United States v. Cunningham, 133 F.3d 1070, 1075 (8th Cir.1998). The questions of whether there was improper outside contact and whether such contact was prejudicial are fact questions reviewed for clear error.

In his motion for voluntary dismissal the plaintiff, by way of his counsel’s affidavit, asserts that recognition of problems of proof required that the litigation be ended despite the fact that the action was based on a good faith belief that the defendant had engaged in race discrimination. The public policies underlying Title VII require that a prevailing defendant be entitled to attorney’s fees only upon a showing that: ...

The Fifth Circuit has explained that: To determine the length of plaintiffs delay, the court must look not to the date on which the patent was issued but rather to the time at which the plaintiff knew or, in the exercise of reasonable diligence, should have known of the defendant’s alleged infringing action. See TWM Manufacturing Co., Inc. v. Dura Corp., 592 F.2d at 349 (period of delay begins to run from the notice of infringement given to defendant); Maloney-Crawford Tank Corp. v. Rocky Mountain Natural Gas Co., Inc., 494 F.2d [401] at 403 (where known infringement began before plaintiff obtained title to patent, delay is measured from the time the title was obtained);  REDACTED d at 1326. The question of from when the period of delay should be measured is much-disputed by the parties. Defendant argues that Plaintiff waited longer than six years to file its lawsuit. Specifically, Nippon contends that its last alleged act of infringement occurred in November, 1975, when it shipped catalyst to Rohm and Haas. At worst, Nippon reasons, Plaintiffs had notice of the infringement by Nippon in May, 1975, when Plaintiff filed a complaint regarding Rohm and Haas’ use of the catalyst in tests performed in Philadelphia before the International Trade Commission (ITC).

The testimony of Mwebe and others was supported by significant corroborating documentary evidence, including the transcript of a telephone conversation in which Kasenge made admissions suggesting that he consented to Mayanja’s use of his documents.

"PER CURIAM. ORDER The Secretary of Veterans Affairs responds to the court’s December 4, 2007 order and requests that the court summarily affirm the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims in Herring v. Principi, 01-2148 (June 1, 2004). The Board of Veterans’ Appeals denied an increased rating for service-connected cephalagia, currently rated as 30% disabling. The Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims vacated the Board’s decision to the extent that it denied a rating in excess of 30% for cephalagia and remanded the case to the Board, and the Secretary appealed. This case was stayed pending the court’s disposition in Roan v. Principi, 2004-7093, which was stayed pending the court’s disposition in  REDACTED  and its companion case Simmons v. Nicholson, 487 F.3d 892 (Fed. Cir.2007). In Sanders, this court held that any 38 U.S.C. § 5103(a) error should be presumed prejudicial and the Secretary has the burden of rebutting this presumption. Id. at 891. The court agrees that summary affirmance of the judgment vacating in part and remanding to the Board is appropriate in light of our decisions in Simmons and Sanders. Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED THAT: (1) The stay of proceedings is lifted. (2) The judgment of the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims is summarily affirmed. The case is remanded. (3) Each side shall bear its own costs. The Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims stated that the Board’s denial of Bobby P.",684891

Thus, the court must determine whether the Provider Agreement constitutes an executory contract and, if so, whether it has been assumed by the estate. 1. Executory Contract Nature of the Provider Agreement The majority of courts that have addressed the issue of whether the Provider Agreement under the Medicare scheme is an executory contract have answered in the affirmative.

If a court finds that an indictment is duplicitous it must take one of two courses of action; it must either dismiss the duplicitous count in the indictment, or require the government to make an election to select and charge one, but not all, of the offenses embraced in the duplicitous count. See Sourlis, 953 F.Supp. at 572; United States v. Starks, 515 F.2d 112, 117 (3d Cir.1975)(fínding that a single count charging conspiracy to extort and attempt to extort was duplicitous and requiring an election). A duplicitous indictment cannot be cured by a bill of particulars.  REDACTED 1 Charles Alan Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure, Criminal §§ 125, 129 (3d ed.1999). The Supreme Court articulated the reason behind this rule in Russell v. United States: To allow the prosecutor, or the court, to make a subsequent guess as to what was in the minds of the grand jury at the time they returned the indictment would deprive the defendant of a basic protection which the guaranty of the intervention of a grand jury was designed to secure.

"-names or terms is obvious, but “Globe” has no such geographical significance; it identifies no particular geographical location, nor is its proper use as a trade-mark likely to interfere with or embarrass any public or private right.

Because Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e) requires that a motion to alter or amend a judgment be filed within ten days after entry of the judgment, defendant has also moved for an enlargement of time pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 6(b)(2). While Rule 6(b) deals with enlargements of time periods, it expressly provides that a district court may not extend the time periods stated in Rule 59(b), (d), and (e). It is well established that a district court has no authority to enlarge the Rule 59(e) ten day time limitation. See Center for Nuclear Responsibility, Inc. v.

I would not construe Graham, however, as mandating a disregard of any pertinent probative evidence on the question of obviousness. Other cases, indeed earlier cases, without referring to the aspects under consideration as secondary have dealt with the present issue.

"a matter of fact the framers of the Constitution may have intended the privileges and immuni ties clause to play the role that has come to be associated more with the “negative” commerce clause. See Eule, Laying the Dormant Commerce Clause to Rest, 91 Yale L.J. 425, 447-48 (1982). But almost 200 years of judicial interpretation have opened up a wedge between the two clauses. For example, the privileges and immunities clause has been held not to protect corporations. See, e.g., W.C.M. Window Co. v. Bernardi, 730 F.2d 486, 492-93 (7th Cir.1984). A more pertinent example is that it has been held not to protect the full range of activities in which nonresidents might engage. See, e.g.,  REDACTED So we shall have to address the plaintiffs commerce clause contentions separately- (though briefly), and also his equal protection contentions; but we shall begin with privileges and immunities.

Thus, factual issues remain as to whether Plaintiff was terminated as a result of filing an EEOC charge; and Contour’s motion for summary judgment is denied as to Count V. Count I In Count I, Plaintiff claims he was fired in retaliation for filing a workers’-compensation claim. To establish a claim for retaliatory discharge under Illinois law, a plaintiff must prove the following three elements: (1) that he was an employee of the defendant prior to the injury; (2) that he exercised a right under the Illinois Workers’ Compensation Act; and (3) that his discharge was causally related to the exercise of that right.

The pre-arrest display of photographs was perfectly proper and conducted in such a manner as to indicate a total absence of suggestiveness. Simmons v.

Analysis The record shows that Mr. Kirby engaged in offensive behavior toward Ms. Tilghman over the three-plus years she worked for him. We do not determine, however, whether a reasonable jury could find that his conduct created an actionable hostile work environment because summary judgment for the Board can be affirmed on an alternative ground. The Board is not vicariously liable for Mr. Kirby’s harassment if it can establish the affirmative defense announced in Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, 524 U.S. 775, 118 S.Ct. 2275, 141 L.Ed.2d 662 (1998), and Burlington Industries, Inc. v. Ellerth, 524 U.S. 742, 118 S.Ct. 2257, 141 L.Ed.2d 633 (1998).

However, not all fiduciary relationships fall within the purview of § 523(a)(4). Woldman, 92 F.3d at 547. A fiduciary relationship qualifies under § 523(a)(4) only if it “imposes real duties in advance of the breach.... ” Marchiando, 13 F.3d at 1116.

Because we agree with Sanchez as to the first of these arguments, we need not reach the second. Before turning to the merits of Sanchez's appeal, however, we must pause to consider our jurisdiction. As a general matter, whether to grant Sanchez cancellation of removal is a discretionary decision that is beyond our jurisdiction to review. E.g. ,  REDACTED see 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(B)(i).

Legal Standard For Issuing a Stay Under Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 8005 When deciding whether to issue a discretionary stay pending a bankruptcy appeal, courts use the following four factors: (1) Movant’s likelihood of success on the merits of the appeal; (2) significant and/or irreparable harm that will come to Movant absent a stay; (3) harm to the adverse party if a stay is granted; and (4) where the public interest lies.  REDACTED In re: Wymer, 5 B.R. at 806. Because these factors were imported from the standard for deciding preliminary injunctions or staying them pending appeal, district courts in this circuit have not agreed on how to apply the discretionary stay factors when deciding whether to stay a final bankruptcy court order pending appeal.

"summary judgment because no caselaw clearly established that the degree of force used by the deputies violated Roell’s Fourth Amendment rights. In doing so, we have reached no conclusion with respect to whether Roell’s rights were actually violated. We must therefore address Nancy Roell’s three theories for Hamilton County’s liability by assuming, without deciding, that Roell’s Fourth Amendment rights were violated by the deputies’ excessive use of force. Hamilton County is subject to liability under § 1983 for its policy on handling’mentally ill individuals only if Nancy Roell can “demonstrate ‘a direct causal link between the policy and the alleged constitutional violation.’” See Brown v.

"defendant David Goldstein moves for reconsideration of that portion of the Court’s September 14, 1998 Memorandum & Order which denied Goldstein’s motion to dismiss Counts Two, Four, Five, and Twenty-Two on statute of limitations grounds. Having considered Goldstein’s arguments, the Court adheres to its prior ruling. Each member of a conspiracy remains responsible for the known or reasonably foreseeable acts committed by his eoconspirators in furtherance of a conspiracy, unless and until he takes an affirmative action to withdraw from the conspiracy. See Pinkerton v. United States, 328 U.S. 640, 646, 66 S.Ct. 1180, 90 L.Ed. 1489 (1946); United States v.

Here, the Indictment properly charges that defendants, including Goldstein, committed substantive offenses within the statute of limitations period in furtherance of a conspiracy to defraud the federal government. Contrary to Goldstein’s characterization, nothing about the Government’s theory “revives” or “reincarnates” an offense that would otherwise be time-barred.

Such, too, has been held the ease where a statute results in the increase of either the minimum or the maximum provision of an indeterminate sentence law, even where an accused could receive the same sentence under either statute because of the discretion allowed some authority. This rule has been followed where the statutes involved discretionary power since they would entail a change of possible disadvantage to the committed person. In re Lambrecht, 137 Mich. 450, 100 N.W. 606; People of United States ex rel. Umbenhower v. McDonnell, D.C.N.D.Ill.E.D.1934, 11 F.Supp. 1014;  REDACTED upp. 70.

No one can doubt from the undisputed record that if the Legislature had not amended the good-time schedules, Thompson would now be a free man.

"a claim, the plaintiff must show: (1) the harm ultimately caused was foreseeable and fairly direct; (2) a state actor acted with a degree of culpability that shocks the conscience; (3) a relationship between the state and the plaintiff existed such that the plaintiff was a foreseeable victim of the defendant’s acts, or a member of a discrete class of persons subject to the potential harm brought about by the state’s actions, as opposed to a member of the public in general; and (4) a state actor affirmatively used his or her authority in a way that created a danger to the citizen or that rendered the citizen more vulnerable to danger than had the state not acted at all.

"must return a verdict fixing the punishment of the defendant at imprisonment for life.... The jury returned a verdict fixing the punishment at death. The verdict form recites that it found beyond a reasonable doubt both the statutory aggravating circumstance, “Torture, Depravity of mind and that as a result it was outrageous and wantonly vile, horrible and inhuman,” and a non-statutory aggravating circumstance, LaRette’s 1974 rape conviction in Douglas County, Kansas. LaRette argues that this instruction is unconstitutionally vague because the term “depravity of mind” does not provide clear and objective standards that adequately channel the sentencer’s discretion in a way that can be rationally reviewed, citing Godfrey v. Georgia, 446 U.S. 420, 100 S.Ct. 1759, 64 L.Ed.2d 398 (1980), and  REDACTED We rejected this precise argument in Battle v.

Bd., 229 F.3d 478, 483 (5th Cir.2000). To defeat a claim of qualified immunity, a petitioner must state a claim for a violation of a constitutional right, show that the constitutional right was established at the time of the actions at issue, and demonstrate that defendant’s conduct was objectively unreasonable in light of the legal rules clearly established when the defendant acted.  REDACTED Conclusory allegations of wrongdoing do not satisfy these requirements. Geter v. Fortenberry, 849 F.2d 1550, 1553 (5th Cir.1988).

The asset and liability structure of the debtor; 6. The prejudice to the debtor relative to the prejudice to the taxing authority from inconsistent assessments. In re Galvano, 116 B.R. at 372. As a general proposition, the policy underlying determinations of tax liability pursuant to § 505 is to protect creditors. Id. However, where the debtor’s general unsecured creditors will not benefit from the requested reassessment, bankruptcy courts generally abstain from exercising their discretion under § 505(a)(1),; In re Eddyville Corp. 1998 WL 106143 (S.D.N.Y.

"limited by the language of the statute, can or should be applied. Courts have strictly construed the scope of § 2112(a) and held that the first filing rule does not apply where competing petitions for review challenge closely related but nevertheless distinct agency orders. See, e.g., Midwest Video Corp. v. United States, 362 F.2d 259, 261 (8th Cir.1966). This does not suggest that a court cannot, in an exercise of its discretion, transfer a matter to another forum, see American Civil Liberties Union v. FCC., 486 F.2d 411, 414 (D.C.Cir.1973), and it may well be that, in various circumstances, such a transfer would not only speed resolution of a case but further the interests of justice. See  REDACTED Whether such circumstances exist here is a question the parties have not addressed; but, as shall be seen, it need not be answered here. The only point is that the first filing rule is no impediment to our assertion of jurisdiction in this case, leading us to the next question of whether, venue problems aside, we even can or should intervene in the withdrawal proceedings at this early stage.

"Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. See for example Complaint Paragraphs quoted in Appendix A and the allegations of Complaint Paragraphs 49-63. 3. As for the Academy’s claim that there are no adequate allegations of a “group boycott,” the allegations just referred to are plainly sufficient to overcome the Academy’s motion to dismiss. 4. There is some limited case support for the Academy’s argument that the Complaint fails adequately to allege a conspiracy. Several decisions involving ordinary business corporations have held that antitrust claims cannot be premised on a “conspiracy” between such a corporation and its own officers. Those decisions are of course distinguishable from the situation involving an association (an entity separate from its constituent members); but .one decision  REDACTED In the opinion of this Court, that analysis cannot fairly apply to an association such as the Academy, and this Court declines to follow Hatley.

"section 362(a), the filing of a bankruptcy petition creates a broad automatic stay protecting the property of the debtor. Ordinarily, any action taken in violation of the stay is void and without effect, Ellis v. Consolidated Diesel Elec. Corp., 894 F.2d 371, 372 (10th Cir.1990), even where there is no actual notice of the existence of the stay, In re Smith, 876 F.2d 524, 526 (6th Cir.1989). Nevertheless, equitable principles may, in some circumstances, be applicable to claimed violations of the stay. The existing case law indicates that courts will apply equitable considerations at least where the creditor was without actual knowledge of a bankruptcy petition and the bankrupt’s unreasonable behavior contributed to the creditor’s plight. See, e.g.,  REDACTED see also Matthews v. Rosene, 739 F.2d 249, 251 (7th Cir.1984) (laches barred debtor's attempt to void a 33-month-old state court judgment on the basis of the automatic stay). In our view, it would be inequitable to allow Calder to claim any protections of the automatic stay under section 362(a) to defeat the Jobs’ state court judgment. The basic undisputed fact apparent from the record is that Calder actively litigated the state court action and did not provide notice of the pending Chapter 13 proceeding until just before the state court was",830043

The Bounds Court emphasized that legal assistance for prisoners is particularly important in the context of discretionary appeals, collateral attacks and civil rights actions. It stated: [I]n this case, we are concerned in large part with original actions seeking new trials, release from confinement, or vindication of fundamental civil rights. Rather than presenting claims that have been passed on by two courts, they frequently raise heretofore unlitigated issues.

Warwick, 167 F.3d 965 (6th Cir.1999), the Court concluded that by accepting a weapon offered by an undercover agent, a defendant does not actively do anything because his conduct is inherently passive. The Court found Ul-loa and Cannon distinguishable because defendants in those cases had actively devised the plan for the exchange of drugs for guns. Warwick, 167 F.3d at 976. See also United States v. Layne, 192 F.3d 556 (6th Cir.1999) (following Warwick). Similarly, in  REDACTED  the Court reversed a conviction and applied the passive conduct approach where the government agent provided the gun.

If and when a factual statement is present, however, it is intertwined with argument, opinion or conclusion that requires an exhausting process to pick apart the offending paragraph, something that this Court will not undertake.

The two instances of suspension and administrative leave of which Hartzol has complained are adverse employment actions. With respect to these two adverse employment actions, Hartzol does not need to show that his performance was satisfactory.

Thus, after looking at the plain text and the history, the Eleventh Circuit concluded that § 2G2.2 should only be used to punish crimes related to trafficking in child pornography, and § 2G2.4 should be left for punishing those who “merely possess child pornography.” Id. We recognize that in contrast the Seventh Circuit has made some statements that support the Government’s position that conviction for receipt requires sentencing under § 2G2.2.

Am. VII. Therefore, in reviewing a motion for judgment as a matter of law under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50(b), the Court must give substantial deference to the jury’s verdict. Radvansky v. City of Olmsted Falls, 496 F.3d 609, 614 (6th Cir.2007). “The motion may be granted only if in viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, there is no genuine issue of material fact for",549664
"Id. at 661, 107 S.Ct. 2617. The Court also emphasized that the “historical interrelationship” of statutes originating under the Civil Rights Act of 1866 are a reason for construing them similarly. Tillman v. Wheaton-Haven Recreation Assoc., Inc. 410 U.S. 431, 93 S.Ct. 1090, 35 L.Ed.2d 403 (1973). Based on the foregoing, this Court finds that the personal injury statute of limitations is also appropriate for § 1982 causes of action. Multiple circuits concur in this result and have found that the § 1982 causes of action should be treated like § 1983 and § 1981 claims for statute of limitations purposes. See, e.g., Baker v. F & F Investment, 420 F.2d 1191, 1198 (7th Cir.1970);  REDACTED (1985); Scheerer v. Rose State College, 774 F.Supp. 620, 622 (W.D.Okla.1991); Mitchell v. Sung 816 F.Supp. 597, 601 (N.D.Cal.1993). Because the Court views § 1982 and § 1983 the same for statute of limitations purposes, the Court must evaluate which statute of limitations applies in this instance. In Wilson, the Supreme Court sought to resolve, “the conflict, confusion, and uncertainty concerning the appropriate statute of limitations to apply to this most important, and ubiquitous, civil rights statute... ”. Wilson, 471 U.S. at 266, 105 S.Ct. 1938. As discussed above, the Court held that 42 U.S.C. § 1988 requires courts to borrow and apply to all § 1983 claims",160766
"duty to defend under the D & 0 policy and to recover attorney’s fees paid in the underlying Bursten suit. After considering the parties’ cross-motions for summary judgment and hearing oral argument, the district court entered summary judgment in Travelers’s favor. Because the sole basis for Bursten’s lawsuit was water damage to the condominium property that resulted in leaking, mold, and loss of use of the owner’s unit, the district court determined that the underlying claim arose out of damage or destruction to tangible property. The district court therefore concluded that the property damage exclusion applied and that Travelers had no duty to defend East-pointe. This appeal followed. II. We review the district court’s grant of summary judgment de novo.  REDACTED Summary judgment is appropriate when the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, presents no genuine issue of material fact and compels judgment as a matter of law.

Fireman’s Fund Ins. Co. v. Tropical Shipping & Constr. Co., 254 F.3d 987, 1003 (11th Cir.2001).

"""REMANDED. . This appeal comes to us on a partial denial of Defendant Miller's motion to dismiss, as opposed to a motion for summary judgment. The district court did not, nor shall we, consider whether a genuine issue of material fact exists. Thus, """"we do not face the appellate jurisdictional problem that may be entangled with a qualified immunity analysis on summary judgment. Cf. Johnson v. Jones, 515 U.S. 304, 319-20, 115 S.Ct. 2151, 132 L.Ed.2d 238 (1995) (holding that 'a defendant, entitled to invoke a qualified immunity defense, may not appeal a district court’s summary judgment order insofar as that order determines whether or not the pretrial record sets forth a ‘genuine’ issue of fact for trial’).’’  REDACTED . In Crawford-El v. Britton, 523 U.S. 574, 597, 118 S.Ct. 1584, 140 L.Ed.2d 759 (1998), the Supreme Court rejected any requirement that a plaintiff adduce clear and convincing evidence of improper motive to defeat a government official’s motion for summary judgment based on qualified immunity. The Court stated that the fairness rational for qualified immunity “does not provide any justification for the imposition of special burdens on plaintiffs who allege misconduct that was plainly unlawful when it occurred.” Id. at 591, 118 S.Ct. 1584. The Court, however, also stated that """"the court may insist that the plaintiff put forward specific, nonconclusory factual allegations that establish improper motive causing cognizable injury in order to survive a prediscovery motion for dismissal""",190564
"1005, 39 L.Ed.2d 260 (1974). The requirement of actual damages has been described by commentators as the majority rule, see Prosser & Keeton on the Law of Torts § 2, at 14 (5th ed.1984), but it has also been sharply criticized, see id; see also Restatement (Second) of Torts § 908 cmt. (c) (1979) (“[I]t is not essential to the recovery of punitive damages that the plaintiff should have suffered any harm, either pecuniary or physical.”). On the opposite side, some other courts have held that an award of nominal damages is sufficient to support punitive damages, see, e.g., Action House, Inc. v. Koolik, 54 F.3d 1009, 1013-14 (2d Cir.1995) (New York law);  REDACTED Am. Bus. Interiors, Inc. v. Haworth, Inc., 798 F.2d 1135, 1146-47 (8th Cir.1986) (Missouri law); Nappe v. Anschelewitz, Barr, Ansell & Bonello, 97 N.J. 37, 477 A.2d 1224, 1231-32 (1984), though there has been disagreement in this line of cases over whether nominal damages qualify when they are awarded for a technical violation of a legal duty that causes no harm to the plaintiff, as opposed to where nominal damages are awarded because it is impossible to give the harm a dollar value, compare Shell Oil Co. v.

The plea agreement contained a provision wherein Barboza-Maldonado waived the right to challenge his guilty plea or the sentence imposed, either on direct appeal or on collateral review, except where he alleged prosecutorial misconduct or ineffective assistance of counsel. The record reveals that Barboza-Maldonado knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to appeal; therefore, he cannot challenge the district court’s denial of a reduction for acceptance of responsibility unless he can demonstrate that the Government breached the plea agreement. See United States v. Bond, 414 F.3d 542, 544 (5th Cir.2005) (citing United States v. McKinney, 406 F.3d 744, 746-47 (5th Cir.2005));  REDACTED The record further reveals that the Government complied with all of its obligations under the plea agreement by not bringing any additional criminal charges, not contesting Barboza-Maldonado’s eligibility for an acceptance of responsibility reduction, and by moving for dismissal of any remaining counts of the indictment.

The 1993 agreement was for Defendant to market, sell, and distribute the cream developed by Plaintiff using Plaintiffs drug delivery system and Defendant’s Flutrimazole after obtaining the necessary approval from the EEC countries. The “contemplated future consequences” would not occur in Missouri, nor did “the parties’ actual course of dealing.” Moreover, Plaintiffs performance of its part of the contract in Missouri does not give Defendant warning that it might be haled into a Missouri court. Rather, the warning would be given by Defendant’s activities. See Porter, 293 F.3d at 1075. The telephone calls and letters do not suffice. Defendant’s representatives did come to Missouri once. This visit too is insufficient. See  REDACTED Morris, 923 F.2d at 1281 (similar holding when there was a total of three trips).

Three additional actions against Omni filed by the heirs of the other passenger, Bert Hol-lier, in the United States District Court for the Western District of Louisiana have recently been transferred to this Court and consolidated with these actions. .

"§ 5 of the Indian Reorganization Act. 25 U. S. C. § 465. A Section 465 provides, in part, that “any lands or rights acquired” pursuant to any provision of the Act “shall be taken in the name of the United States in trust for the Indian tribe or individual Indian for which the land is acquired, and such lands or rights shall be exempt from State and local taxation.” On its face, the statute exempts land and rights in land, not income derived from its use. It is true that a statutory tax exemption for “lands” may, in light of its context and purposes, be con strued to support an exemption for taxation on income derived from the land. See  REDACTED cf. Superior Bath House Co. v. McCarroll, 312 U. S. 176 (1941). But, absent clear statutory guidance, courts ordinarily will not imply tax exemptions and will not exempt off-reservation income from tax simply because the land from which it is derived, or its other source, is itself exempt from tax. “This Court has repeatedly said that tax exemptions are not granted by implication. ... It has applied that rule to taxing acts affecting Indians as to all others. ...

See Haddock v. Bd. of Dental Examiners of Calif., 777 F.2d 462, 463-64 (9th Cir.1985). Martin does not allege that the DRE is involved in the day-to-day operations of real estate brokers to such a degree that Title VII would apply to its activities. See Ass’n of Mexican-American Educators v. State of Calif., 231 F.3d 572, 580-84 (9th Cir.2000) (en banc).

The Defendants thus have failed to exhaust the arbitration procedures which is a prerequisite to judicial review of a dispute under Section 301. See,  REDACTED Drake Bakeries v.

In addition, any information supporting a FCA action that Relator gained through his analysis of existing data is also insufficiently direct to make him an original source. Although Relator argues that his particular interdisciplinary expertise and background allow him to understand the significance of publicly disclosed information, that is not enough to qualify him as an original source.

The recalculated awards are set forth in the Allocation of Damage Awards table which appears at the conclusion of this section. A. PRE-JUDGMENT INTEREST Stating that the award of prejudgment interest is the rule rather than the exception, the Court of Appeals directed this court to calculate and award prejudgment interest. 674 F.2d at 415-16. The purpose behind an award of pre-judgment interest, in admiralty cases as elsewhere, is to compensate a claimant for the loss of use of funds to which he is rightfully entitled. 674 F.2d at 415, quoting  REDACTED Before it can calculate the award of pre-judgment interest, however, this court must first answer three questions. These are: (1) what rate of interest to use; (2) whether to calculate interest on a simple or a compound basis; and (3) the date from which pre-judgment interest should run. 1. The Rate of Interest Since pre-judgment interest is awarded as compensation for the use of funds wrongfully withheld, admiralty courts have discretion in setting the rate of pre-judgment interest.

Later decisions followed the implications of Heckman and held that the right of the United States to institute a suit to protect the allotment did not diminish the Indian’s right to sue on his own behalf. In  REDACTED  this Court held that Indian tribes had the power to sue a railroad for the improper use of Indian land even though the tribes could not sue the United States for its failure to collect the sums allegedly due.

When a petitioner is physically detained, the custodian generally is the warden of the facility where the petitioner is confined. Padilla, 542 U.S. at 435, 124 S.Ct. 2711. A habeas petitioner who is physically confined must name this “immediate custodian” as the habeas respondent, and must file the habeas petition in the “district of confinement.” Id. at 446-47, 124 S.Ct. 2711.

Congress enacted section 523(d) out of concern that creditors were using the threat of litigation to induce consumer debtors to settle for reduced sums, even though the debtors were in many cases entitled to discharge. [...] However, creditors are entitled to recover attorney’s fees in bankruptcy claims if they have a contractual right to them under state law, which appears to be the case here.... We do not think that section 523(d) prevents the award of attorney’s fees and costs to creditors so entitled as a matter of contract under state law.

"the federal nature of the claim. Id. at 694-95. If the prisoner files a federal petition without exhausting his state-court remedies, and such remedies remain available to the prisoner, then the federal claim is deemed unexhausted and the federal court will ordinarily dismiss it without prejudice so that the prisoner can return to state court and exhaust the remaining remedies. Id. at 696. If, however, the prisoner did not fairly present his federal claim to the proper state courts, and it is now too late to return to those courts to do so, then the prisoner is deemed to have exhausted his state-court remedies but faces the prospect of having his federal claims dismissed based on procedural default.

The procedural-default doctrine generally precludes a federal court from reaching the merits of a habeas claim when either (1) that claim was presented to the state courts and the state-court ruling against the petitioner rests on adequate and independent state-law procedural grounds, or (2) the claim was not presented to the state courts and it is clear that those courts would now hold the claim procedurally barred.

"of the litigation, because the representative plaintiffs claim is too small to justify the expense of litigation. Coopers & Lybrand v. Livesay, 437 U.S. 463, 98 S.Ct. 2454, 57 L.Ed.2d 351 (1978), held that an order declining to certify a class is not appealable, even if that decision dooms the suit as a practical matter. Rule 23(f) gives appellate courts discretion to entertain appeals in “death knell” cases— though we must be wary lest the mind hear a bell that is not tolling. Many class suits are prosecuted by law firms with portfolios of litigation, and these attorneys act as champions for the class even if the representative plaintiff would find it uneconomical to carry on with the case. E.g.,  REDACTED These law firms may carry on in the hope of prevailing for a single plaintiff and then winning class certification (and the reward of larger fees) on appeal, extending the victory to the whole class.

"states that insurance coverage ends “when the group contracts are discontinued.” Shenango reasons that its obligation to maintain insurance coverage under the collective bargaining agreement does not extend beyond the expiration of the agreement itself, therefore, its failure to pay premiums after the agreement expired was justified. Shenango’s reasoning, however, is unpersuasive. The collective bargaining agreement contains a broad no-strike clause which prohibits strikes during the duration of the agreement. Strikes occurring while the labor agreement is in effect are violative of the no-strike clause and are therefore unlawful. An unlawful strike would entitle Shenango to injunctive relief, Boys Markets, Inc. v. Retail Clerks Union, 398 U.S. 235, 90 S.Ct. 1583, 26 L.Ed.2d 199 (1970), damages against the Union,  REDACTED  and subject the employees to termination under Article II, section 2 of the collective bargaining agreement. Moreover, the Group Insurance Plan itself provides that upon termination of employment, employees’ insurance coverage will cease immediately. The only exception to the broad no-strike clause in the collective bargaining agreement appears in Article XIX, section 2. This section permits the employees to strike if the Steelworkers Union and Shenango fail to renegotiate a new contract by midnight February 28, 1983, when the agreement was scheduled to expire. Since strikes occurring during the duration of the agreement are expressly prohibited, the six-months “coverage-during-strike” clause in the Group Insurance Plan, as a practical matter, becomes operative only after the collective bargaining",461628
"""All these differences affect whether a prior conviction qualifies as a """"serious drug offense"""" within the meaning of the ACCA. 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(1). In Taylor v. United States , 495 U.S. 575, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990), the Supreme Court established a methodology for analyzing whether a prior conviction qualifies as a predicate offense under the ACCA.

Id. at 600, 110 S.Ct. 2143. The """"means by which the defendant, in real life, committed his crimes"""" has """"no relevance to whether the offense is an ACCA predicate.""""  REDACTED Instead, the task is to assess whether the state statute penalizes only conduct that qualifies as a predicate under the federal statute. If the state statute penalizes """"a greater swath of conduct"""" than the federal provision, the state statute is deemed categorically overbroad and the conviction does not trigger the mandatory minimum. Id. In assessing a statute's reach, federal courts often look to state courts' interpretations of the statute. See United States v. Grisel , 488 F.3d 844, 850-51 (9th Cir. 2007).

"the noncompliance. Gompers, 221 U.S. 418, 448-449, 31 S.Ct. 492, 500-501, 55 L.Ed. 797. Thus, there are two forms of civil contempt: compensatory and coercive. United States v. Asay, 614 F.2d 655, 659 (9th Cir.1980). A contempt adjudication is plainly civil in nature when the sanction imposed is wholly remedial, serves only the purposes of the complainant, and is not intended as a deterrent to offenses against the public. McCrone v. United States, 307 U.S. 61, 64, 59 S.Ct. 685, 686, 83 L.Ed. 1108 (1939). A court’s power to impose coercive civil contempt depends upon the ability of the contemnor to comply with the court’s coercive order. See Shillitani v. United States, 384 U.S. at 371, 86 S.Ct. at 1536 (citing  REDACTED While civil contempt may have an incidental effect of vindicating the court’s authority and criminal contempt may permit an adversary to derive incidental benefit from the fact that the sanction tends to prevent a repetition of the disobedience, such incidental effects do not change the primary purpose of either type of contempt. Gompers, 221 U.S. at 443, 31 S.Ct. at 498.

Under this line of reasoning, Kelley dismissed Title VII claims against the defendant employers in their official capacities as redundant, pointing out that the employer was already a named defendant. Kelley, 923 F.Supp. at 1499. Similarly, the court finds that the Title VII claim against Defendant Monday in his official capacity is due to be dismissed because Plaintiffs employer, the Dale County Board of Education, is a named defendant. Defendant Monday also moves that the Title IX claim against him in his individual capacity be dismissed. Defendant Monday argues that such claims apply only to entities that receive federal funds rather than to individual defendants. In  REDACTED  this court found that actions to enforce the provisions of Title IX can only be directed against the educational institution involved, finding “no indication in the statute” that such actions could be directed elsewhere. Id. at 1387. In Holt, the court dismissed all Title IX claims against several university officials in an action against a university. Id. The facts in the instant case are similar: Plaintiff has commenced a Title IX action, inter alia, against an educational institution (Defendant Board) and one of its officials (Defendant Monday).

"unpublished PER' CURIAM opinion. Unpublished opinions are not binding precedent in this circuit. PER CURIAM: Franklin Charles Smith seeks to appeal the district court’s order accepting the recommendation of the magistrate judge and denying relief on his 28 U.S.C. § 2254 (2012) petition. The order is not appeal-able unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certifícate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. § 2253(c)(1)(A) (2012). A certificate of appealability will not issue absent “a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.” 28 U.S.C. § 2253(c)(2) (2012). When the district court denies relief on the merits, a prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that the district court’s assessment of the constitutional claims is debatable or wrong.

"applicable to section 3109. Sabbath v. United States, supra, 391 U.S. at 591 n. 8, 88 S.Ct. 1755. Lower courts have, in fact, engrafted certain exceptions onto section 3109. One of these may be termed the “useless gesture” exception. Cf. Miller v. United States, supra, 357 U.S. at 310, 78 S.Ct. 1190; Hair v. United States, 110 U.S.App.D.C. 153, 155, n. 9, 289 F.2d 894, 896 n. 9 (1961). In the past it has been applied when the arresting officers were justified in being virtually certain that the person to be arrested knew their purpose, and hence compliance with section 3109 would a “useless gesture.” See, e. g., Wittner v.

We think application of the “useless gesture” exception to the case at bar is appropriate. We note that the officers oiginally attempted to comply with section 3109 by knocking on the partially open door. They received no response and apparently knocked again. Then, noting that appellant was asleep on the couch they entered the apartment through the open door, awakened appellant and announced their purpose. Since appellant had not been awakened by their knocking, the officers could reasonably have concluded that further knocking or verbal announcement would be a “useless gesture.” Indeed, it appears that at this point the most practical means available to the officers",233902

Cal.Penal Code § 17(b) (West 1996). At oral argument of this appeal, counsel for Diaz stated that “there was never a judgment entered.” Accordingly, the first method of exercising discretion to reduce the felony to a misdemeanor was not exercised by the state court. There is nothing in the record to show that the second method was used. The presumption that the conviction was of a felony has not been overcome. See Garcia-Lopez v. Ashcroft, 334 F.3d 840, 844-45 (9th Cir.2003);  REDACTED United States v. Robinson, 967 F.2d 287, 292-93 (9th Cir.1992).

The FLSA regulates minimum and overtime wages paid by employers engaged in interstate commerce. Id. (citation omitted).

It provides: “A court of the United States may not grant an injunction to stay proceedings in a State court except as expressly authorized by Act of Congress, or where necessary in aid of its jurisdiction, or to protect or effectuate its judgments.” 28 U.S.C. § 2283 (1965). “It is settled that the prohibition of § 2283 cannot be evaded by addressing the order to the parties or prohibiting utilization of the results of a completed state proceeding.” Atlantic Coast Line, supra, 398 U.S. at 287, 90 S.Ct. at 1743. See also Wright, Law of Federal Courts, § 47, pp. 180-81 (2d Ed. 1970). But see  REDACTED  (White, J., dissenting). The injunction sought by the Plaintiffs does not fall under any of the specific statutory exceptions listed in § 2283, as required by Atlantic Coast Line, supra. Consequently, § 2283 deprives this Court of jurisdiction, either to grant an injunction against enforcement of the state court judgment or to do so indirectly by declaring such judgment to be unconstitutional. See Euge v. Smith, 418 F.2d 1296 (8th Cir. 1969), (Blackman, J.); Hartsville Theatres, Inc. v. Fox, 324 F.Supp. 258, 262-64 (D.S.C.1971). III.

"testimony was based on, summarized, and was consistent with the evidence presented at trial, and that there would have been “little, if any reason” to sequester him. Morvant v. Construction Aggregates Corp., 570 F.2d 626, 629-30 (6th Cir.1978) (little if any reason to sequester a witness who is to testify in an expert capacity only and not to the facts of the case). Lussier was not prejudiced by the decision to allow Soares to remain in court, which consequently was not an abuse of the district court’s discretion. See United States v. Jewett, 520 F.2d 581, 584 (1st Cir.1975). Exclusion of Exhibits In a supplemental brief, Lussier called attention to the recent Supreme Court deci sion in  REDACTED In Cheek, the Court overturned a tax evasion conviction where the district court had instructed the jury that a defendant’s good-faith misunderstanding of the requirements of the law would negate willfullness only if the misunderstanding was “objectively reasonable.” The inquiry, the Court said, should properly focus on what the defendant actually believed; the reasonableness or unreasonableness of a purported belief is relevant only inasmuch as it casts light on the credibility of the defendant’s claim. 111 S.Ct. at 610-12. This has long been the rule in this circuit, see United States v. Aitken, 755 F.2d 188, 191-93 (1st Cir.1985), and the district court’s instructions to the jury followed the law exactly. Lussier contends, however, that the district court violated",829733

So the statute of limitations ran long before Elmore refiled his suit. That in itself need not have been fatal. There are defenses to the statute of limitations, and Elmore is right in identifying equitable tolling as one of them. The running of a statute of limitations can be equitably tolled when through no fault of his own the plaintiff was unable to sue within the limitations period but he sued as soon as he could. E.g., Flight Attendants Against UAL Offset v. Commissioner, 165 F.3d 572, 575-76 (7th Cir.1999);  REDACTED Cada v. Baxter Healthcare Corp., 920 F.2d 446, 451 (7th Cir.1990); Graham-Humphreys v.

Doehler says: “Obviously, the liquidated damage clause in the re-let contract was to liquidate damages ‘for delay.’ Although no such clause is to be found in the Doehler contract, it cannot be denied that under its contract Doehler was liable for damages ‘for delay.’ However, Doehler’s liability was not liquidated.

"circumstances shown, appellees did or failed to do all that common prudence required was a question upon which rational minds might differ. The question was one of fact. We gather that on this point the trial judge was not of a contrary mind; his wrestling was with the problem of proximate cause. But if a prima facie case of negligence on appellees’ part had been made out, we think it clear that the question whether their neglect was the proximate cause of the injury or a substantial factor in causing it, Restatement, 2 Torts § 430, Comment a, was for the jury.

"225 F.3d 858, 867 (7th Cir.2000)—cases that are of undisputed vitality within this Circuit. We are convinced that the court’s instruction was proper and that the court’s recitation of the applicable law to the jury was proper. See, e.g., United States v. Smith, 131 F.3d 685, 688 (7th Cir.1997) (commenting favorably on trial court’s use of pattern jury instruction); United States v. Walker, 25 F.3d 540, 547 (7th Cir.1994) (same). We conclude that Hernandez did not suffer any prejudice by the court’s failure to tender his proposed instruction, which would have been redundant, if given in conjunction with the pattern instruction, even if it had accurately stated the law, see United States v. Manjarrez, 258 F.3d 618, 626 (7th Cir.2001);  REDACTED 2. We next examine Hernandez’s claim that the trial judge abused his discretion when refusing to give to the jury any definition of “reasonable doubt.” “[T]he district court is given substantial discretion with respect to the precise wording of jury instructions, so long as the instruction completely and correctly states the law.” Savino v. C.P. Hall Co., 199 F.3d 925, 934 (7th Cir.1999). Although the Supreme Court has held that trial courts may, in their discretion, instruct the jury on reasonable doubt, Victor v. Nebraska, 511 U.S. 1, 114 S.Ct. 1239, 127 L.Ed.2d 583 (1994), we have long held that courts are not required (and indeed are discouraged) from giving such instructions, for the phrase “reasonable doubt”",726833
"enlargement of time on motion within the time originally prescribed (Danielson did not file such a motion) or on later motion “where the failure to act was the result of excusable neglect.” In re Davis, 936 F.2d 771 (4th Cir.1991), holds, in circumstances identical to Danielson’s, that failure to consult the clerk’s list of claims is not “excusable” neglect. Inattention to the case, unwarranted assumptions about what creditors will do, and the like are common. Treating them as “excusable” neglect would destroy the timing rules by converting every delay into its own reason for an extension. “Excusable neglect” is a common term in rules of procedure, and we regularly hold that sloth, ignorance, and other negligence does not qualify. E.g.,  REDACTED Lorenzen v. Employees Retirement Plan, 896 F.2d 228, 232 (7th Cir.1990); Redfield v. Continental Casualty Corp., 818 F.2d 596, 602 (7th Cir.1987). Danielson contends that Rule 3004 is inconsistent with § 501(c), but we cannot see how. The statute permits debtors and trustees to file proofs of claims on behalf of creditors but does not say when. Rules of procedure fill in such details. Rule 3004 is authorized by the Rules Enabling Act. 28 U.S.C. § 2075. Although Danielson believes that the use of “may” in Rule 3004 implies that the 30 days are not an outer limit, a construction such as “may file within 30 days” sets an enforceable limit.

Section 107(c) states that the death penalty procedures """"shall apply to cases pending on or after the date of enactment of this Act.” Section 107 is not implicated in this noncapital case. One court. — faced with a capital case — has concluded that review of the Act’s purpose, structure and legislative history, indicates Congress intended that the noncapital habeas corpus amendments apply to' cases pending on or after enactment of the Act, the same time as chapter 154’s capital provisions became operative.

Here, however, Perez is not facing a death sentence. Hence, chapter 154, by its very terms, does not apply to this case.

"circumstances presented here both defendants must have been alleged to have been a corporation foreign to Pennsylvania together with the amended requirement that their principal places of business are not within this state.

"believes will remedy the remaining defects in plaintiff’s pleading. While not fully in compliance with the May 8, 1991 Order, the court finds that plaintiff is able to revise the second amended complaint to provide the. minimum requisite specificity indicated by the court. The nexus of a valid claim, for the purposes of these motions, can thus be found in plaintiff’s complaint. The court therefore denies defendant’s motion for dismissal pursuant to RUSCC 41(b). The court warns, however, that if plaintiff’s third amended complaint does not comply with the letter and spirit of this Order, the court would be justified in dismissing the case pursuant to RUSCC 41(b).

We conclude that the government tried Herman promptly enough, and that the “unsatisfactorily severe remedy of dismissal” is not appropriate in this case. Id. at 522. A. The length of the delay The first factor, the length of the delay, serves two roles. First, it serves a threshold role: there must be a delay long enough to be “presumptively prejudicial”. Barker v. Wingo, 407 U.S. at 530, 92 S.Ct. 2182, 33 L.Ed.2d at 117. Here, a twenty-two month and twenty day delay for a relatively simple charge is presumptively prejudicial and serves as a “triggering mechanism” to invoke further analysis. Id.

Second, we must weigh the length of this delay along with the other factors we consider. United States v. Netterville, 5 Cir. 1977, 553 F.2d 903, 914. B. The reasons for the delay Herman, on appeal, seeks to emphasize the second factor, the reasons for the delay. Of course, Herman, rather than the government, is responsible for some of the delay.

The Court stated: “It is fundamental in the law of damages that the injured party is entitled to compensation for loss sustained. Where property is destroyed by wrongful act, the owner is entitled to its money equivalent, and thereby to be put in as good position pecuniarily as if his property had not been destroyed. In case of total loss of a vessel, the measure of damages is its market value, if it has a market value, at the time of destruction.  REDACTED 385, 75 U.S. 377, 19 L.Ed. 463. Where there is no market value such as is established by contemporaneous sales of like property in the way of ordinary business, as in the case of merchandise bought and sold in the market, other evidence is resorted to.

However, the concurring opinion joined the majority with respect to the prospective application, and we read this as incorporating the views we derive from the plurality decision regarding the preclusion of ad hoc challenges to pre-Northem Pipeline bankruptcy decisions. In addition, we take judicial note of the fact that the Judicial Conference and the Judicial Councils, in passing interim rules to give the bankruptcy courts jurisdiction via the district courts, did so assuming that other provisions under the Reform Act would not survive.

Although the scene of the accident and nearly all of the witnesses and records are located in the northern part of New Jersey, and it would probably be more convenient for most of the witnesses to travel five miles or so to Newark rather than 15 or 20 miles to the Southern District of New York, other witnesses are actually closer to the Southern District of New York than to the Federal Courthouse in Newark. Furthermore, all witnesses and records are within the subpoena power of this Court, see Rule 45(d), (e), F.R.Civ.P., which distinguishes the case from decisions cited by defendants, e. g., Mazula v.

However, on this record the circumstances are insufficient to sustain defendants’ burden and to deprive plaintiff of her privilege under § 6 of the Federal Employers’ Liability Act, especially since, as a practical matter, we are dealing with one single large metropolitan area which embraces portions of northern New Jersey. Accordingly, the motion is denied. So ordered.",151587
"on the other hand, the federal authorities in New Jersey had no such copies or if in any event the New York prosecutor was unaware of their possession of the copies, reversal would still be required on grounds of prejudicial error, since the prosecutor would not have been in a position to substitute “innocent” copies had the “tainted” copies been objected to and excluded at the trial. Although, as the Court properly holds, we cannot pass upon the accuracy of this additional evidence in determining the issues before us, I think the Government’s proffer may properly be taken into account in deciding the nature of the judgment we should enter. See 28 U. S. C. § 2106; cf.  REDACTED The petitioner, by making his specific objection to admission of the disputed exhibits for the first time on appeal, gave the Government no occasion to introduce the “innocent” copies at the trial and thereby avoid error.

In these circumstances I think the proper course for us is to vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals as to Lawn, and to remand the case to the District Court for the purpose of determining whether “innocent” copies of these exhibits were within reach of the New York prosecutor at the time of trial.

This conclusion is borne out by our similar analysis of other limitations periods in Title VII and the ADEA. “Since the ADEA and Title VII share a common purpose, the elimination of discrimination in the workplace,” since the language of § 633a(a) & (b) is “almost in haec verba ” with § 2000e-16(a) & (b), and since the legislative history of the ADEA section indicates Title VII was its source, we conclude the two limitations periods are analogous.

"which was likewise denied on January 7, 2002. Pannell now asks us to review the orders of August 27, December 7, and January 7. We have already rejected Pannell’s appeal of the August 27 order as untimely. See Order in Case No. 01-3878 (7th Cir. November 28, 2001). As for the other two orders, we find that they correctly denied Pannell’s request for entry of judgment. Rule 58 requires that judgment in a case be “set forth on a separate document.” Under Rule 54, “judgment” includes “any order from which an appeal lies.” We have made it clear, though, that no separate appeal lies from the denial of a post-judgment motion to alter or amend the judgment, see  REDACTED  which is all that we can construe Pannell’s September 18 motion to have been. Consistent with that principle, we have held that “[a] minute order suffices when the judge denies a request to alter the judgment, for then the original judgment remains in effect.” Charles v. Daley, 799 F.2d 343, 347 (7th Cir.1986). The district court’s September 24 denial of the Motion to Amend Findings of Fact was such an order. Pannell’s citation to Armstrong v.

Zheng’s possession of the ticket stub at the asylum hearing was consistent with this testimony. B. The adverse credibility determination was also based on Zheng’s hospital records. According to the IJ, the records are inconsistent because (1) one states that Zheng had a miscarriage on November 21, 2001, while another states that she had an abortion only a week later on November 28, and (2) they bear different official stamps. Given the record before the IJ, neither of these reasons is persuasive. 1. The IJ’s first reason cannot constitute substantial evidence because it rested on personal speculation.

If Zheng’s uterus had emptied completely on November 21, it would have been impossible for her to have an abortion only a week later. But there was no basis for assuming that is what occurred. There are various types of miscarriages, only some of which involve the complete and unassisted expulsion of the “products of conception” within a short period. See id.

Fullers are claiming interest from the date that the “sustainable” moneys were received by Phillips until the date that the money was actually paid to Fullers by the authority of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in  REDACTED In addition, the Fullers claim that they are entitled to be paid “interest on interest,” that is, for all interest that was due when the money was paid to them, Fullers claim interest on that sum until the date of this judgment and thereafter until paid.

Addressing that issue directly, the government responds with the tautology that a mentally retarded and a non-retarded worker are not in fact similarly situated because the one is in the excepted service while the other is in the competitive service and, therefore, governed by different rules. In rejecting this line of reasoning, we do not suggest that the government may not adopt different standards for treating employees it has chosen to situate differently. We hold only that when the government makes that choice, its reason must rest within the realm of rationality. “[A] statutory discrimination between two like classes cannot be rationalized by assigning them different labels * *  REDACTED There must actually be a distinction between the two classes worthy of the difference in treatment. Here, the distinction is not based on the nature of the position being filled, but on the nature of the employee filling it.

"the four cases relied on by the appellants support the proposition that some form of written notification, plus a claim for a sum certain, must be received by the agency from the claimants. In each case, some type of claim was presented by the claimant to the agency in a timely fashion. None of these cases, however, lends any support to the plaintiffs contention that the filing of a state court action satisfies the requirement of filing an administrative claim. The weight of the case law clearly supports the government’s position that the filing of a suit does not provide sufficient notice to the federal agency. Particularly pertinent to this appeal are decisions by the Eighth and Sixth Circuits. See  REDACTED Rogers v. United States, 675 F.2d 123 (6th Cir.1982). In Meeker, as in the case before us, the plaintiff initially filed suit in state court against the individual government employee. There too the government removed the action to federal court, certified that the employee was acting within the scope of his employment at the time of the accident, and sought to dismiss because of plaintiff’s failure to timely file an administrative claim. The Eighth Circuit dismissed the suit, holding that the plaintiff could not circumvent the statutory requirement of filing an administrative claim by commencing action in state court against an individual employee.

"is the defendant.” United States v. Archibald, 734 F.2d 938, 941-43 (2d Cir. 1984), modified by United States v. Archibald, 756 F.2d 223, 223 (2d Cir. 1984) (noting that defendants wishing to take advantage of its ruling must “move[ ] in a timely manner prior to trial for a lineup”). Likewise, the Fifth Circuit has concluded that “it is obviously suggestive to ask a witness to identify a perpetrator in the courtroom when it is clear who is the defendant.” Rogers, 126 F.3d at 658. The Third Circuit reached the same conclusion under more egregious circumstances, where U.S. marshals walked a defendant in shackles before the key identification witnesses, who then discussed the fact that it must be the defendant.  REDACTED Because these cases pre-dated Perry, none of them discussed its applicability. Since Perry, several circuit courts have decided that it is not impermissibly suggestive to obtain in-court identifications when it is obvious which person is the defendant. Relying on Perry, the Tenth and Eleventh Circuits both concluded that in-court identifications of the defendants, in each case the only African-American man at counsel table, did not warrant judicial reliability assessments because they were not the product of improper conduct by law enforcement. United States v. Thomas, 849 F.3d 906, 910-11 (10th Cir. 2017); United States v. Whatley, 719 F.3d 1206, 1216 (11th Cir. 2013).

The only transfers left for the trustee to avoid would be those transfers the debtor intended to favor certain creditors.

In Fidelity the debtor was in the business of regularly borrowing money from investors for terms of less than one year and then lending it out at higher interest rates. The court found these loans to be close enough to commercial paper to be included in section 547(c)(2), and incurred in the ordinary course of the debtor's business. The analysis of this opinion is somewhat weak, and its only case support is In re CHG Int'l, 87 B.R. at 648, which is the order, prior to amendment, from the case at bar.

"the abortion regulations are vague and over-broad, thus rendering them unconstitutional. Although the questions of vagueness and overbreadth frequently overlap, as in this case, their application is based upon different constitutional principles. Accordingly, they shall be treated separately. The rule against vagueness involves the issue of whether the provisions of a statute are sufficiently definite to give reasonable notice of prohibited conduct to those who wish to avoid its penalties. A statute will be declared void for vagueness if it is so obscure that men of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its applicability. E. g., Cramp v. Board of Public Instruction, 368 U.S. 278, 287, 82 S.Ct. 275, 7 L.Ed.2d 285 (1961). See also  REDACTED The regulations in this case represent a twofold effort on the part of the Chicago Board of Health: first, to ensure that abortion patients will not be maimed or killed in ill-equipped “abortion mills”; and second, to tread as little and as lightly as possible upon a competent physician’s exercise of his professional judgment in the treatment of his patients. Applying the rule against vagueness with these two observations in mind, it cannot possibly be said that, upon reading the abortion regulations, a physician with common knowledge of the procedures, equipment, drugs and dangers involved in the performance of abortions would necessarily guess at their meaning. True, they do not specify which drugs must be kept on hand at an abortion",439427

"33 T.C. 1000. This appeal comes down to this: Is a “transfer” which is otherwise taxable under the general provisions of subparagraph (B) relieved of taxation under the exception, provided only that it occurred prior to March 4, 1931? The answer must be yes, unless we give a different meaning to the word “transfer” when used in the exception than we do to that same word when used in the general provisions of the subparagraph. Where a word or phrase is used in different parts of the same statute, it will be presumed to have the same meaning throughout. Atlantic Cleaners & Dyers, Inc. v. United States, 1932, 286 U.S. 427, 52 S.Ct. 607, 76 L.Ed. 1204;  REDACTED d 560.

Defendants also contend that Plaintiff, in its PAC, does not allege a plausible relevant product market because it does not describe a market that encompasses all interchangeable substitute products and does not define the market with reference to the cross-elasticity of demand and reasonable interchangeability.  REDACTED Defendants note that, for example, Plaintiff provides no indication as to why purchasers of fixed-price baseload natural gas at HSC during bidweek could not substitute gas purchased off exchange or purchased on another exchange for that purchased over ICE. The Court agrees and finds unavailing Plaintiff's caselaw cited for the proposition that an antitrust claim may not be dismissed on a motion to dismiss on the basis of an inadequately defined relevant market.

Allegedly acting with recklessness was sufficient to avoid the “intentional acts” exclusion, and read closely, the complaint alleged defamation both through specific intent to harm, or common-law malice, and through actual malice, which can include reckless disregard for falsity.

Although the court did not elaborate, these documents may have bound the entities to acquire the estate property. There are no such pre-plan agreements in this case.

Just what this “something more” is, however, remains unclear. Certainly, if the individual is a high ranking official of the person-enterprise, then the individual’s wrongdoing is the wrongdoing of the person-enterprise, and the latter will be accountable for the acts of the former.

"this as such a case. In some respects, as pointed out, the situation in Sandnes’ was more suited to give us pause, and to justify a pause for further inquiry. To avert the judgment, therefore, plaintiff must persuade us, contrary to the view of the entire court in Sandnes’, that the statutory scheme is facially unconstitutional or at least unconstitutional as applied to every contractor who cannot furnish a bond to stay execution of the Board order. This is Solitron’s backup position. It expects us to overrule Sandnes’ on the basis of changes in the “legal climate”, i.e., the atmosphere emanating from Supreme Court decisions dealing with “collect now, litigate later” techniques, handed down since the date of Samdnes\ July 14,1972.  REDACTED It shows that “collect now, litigate later” has its limits even in the generally open field of Internal Revenue enforcement.

"property and the rights protected by the Fourteenth Amendment arise not from the mere possession of the property but rather from its use. Lake Country Estates v. Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, 440 U.S. 391, 99 S.Ct. 1171, 59 L.Ed.2d 401 (1979)., From the cases discussed above, it seems equally apparent that the property rights in a mortgage arise not just from the lien in land, but also in the maintenance of the security which makes the mortgage an acceptable investment for the rational investor. It seems also well established that state action which “frustrates distinct investment-backed expectations” of a property owner may form the basis for a finding of a “taking” barred by the Fifth Amendment.  REDACTED  citing Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon, 260 U.S. 393, 43 S.Ct. 158, 67 L.Ed. 322 (1922). It is apparent from the language of the mortgage deed, a copy of which was made an exhibit by plaintiff, that plaintiff took pains to take as security for its loan not just the land at 6802 Superior Avenue, but any buildings on that land as well. Plaintiff had a distinct investment-backed expectation at the time the loan was made that the apartment building on the land would remain, so as to provide security for the debt and to provide a source of funds from which the loan could be repaid.

State-court-only plaintiffs, the leadership group argued, benefited from the common-benefit work and would be unjustly enriched unless the Common Benefit Order was applied to them as well.

The Estate seeks the reversal of the Tax Court Judge’s adoption of the Commissioner’s Rule 155 computation for two principal reasons. First, the Estate asserts that the Commissioner’s elimination of the reduction to the tentative estate tax for “aggregate gift taxes payable (after Dec. 31, 1976)” constituted a “new issue” that the Tax Court Judge was prohibited from addressing under Rule 155.

"held that the post-confirmation chapter 13 estate consists only of those assets necessary for the success of the chapter 13 plan and that the automatic stay insulates post-confirmation earnings only to the extent of the chapter 13 plan payment. “The balance of such post-confirmation earnings belongs to the debtor as her individual property and is not insulated from post-petition claims nor protected by the automatic stay.” Leavell, supra, at 540. In the context of that case where the chapter 13 plan payment was $75.00 per month, this meant that the post-petition creditor could garnish the debtor’s wages in excess of $75.00 per month. Id. at 541-42. Leavell is not alone. See also Ziegler, supra, at 500;  REDACTED Other courts have held that all post-confirmation earnings are part of the chapter 13 estate and are fully protected by the automatic stay.

"action’. Such is the case here. The defendant was not required to plead the compulsory counterclaim since his state court action in New York is pending, but the language of Rule 13(a) clearly gives the defendant the option to counterclaim if he so desires. H. L. Peterson v. Apple-white, 383 F.2d 430 (5th Cir. 1967); Union Paving Co. v. Downer Corp., 276 F.2d 468 (9th Cir. 1960); General Foods Corp. v. Struthers Scientific Corp., 301 F.Supp. 354 (D.Del.1969). See also Moore’s, Para. 1314(2) p. 13-332. The third alternative of ordering the defendants to dismiss the pending state suit as a condition to proceeding with their counterclaim in this court would be improper under the antiinjunction provisions of 28 U.S.C. § 2283.  REDACTED Neifeld v. Steinberg, 438 F.2d 423 (3d Cir. 1971). A state court proceeding may only be enjoined by a federal court in three instances: (a) if authorized by an Act of Congress, (b) when necessary in the aid of the court’s jurisdiction, (e) to protect or effectuate any judgment of the court. None of those exceptions apply here. Therefore, since Sec. 2283 prevents enjoining of the state suit, the third alternative must be abandoned. Neifeld v. Steinberg, supra; Reines Distributors, Inc. v. Admiral Corp., 182 F.Supp. 226 (S.D.N.Y.1960).

The logic undergirding this position, articulated in a patent case, is that “[ajbsent declaratory relief the party who allegedly breached the covenant not to compete would be required to wait until the adverse party brought suit before he could secure a judicial determination of the propriety of his conduct. One of the main purposes of the Declaratory Judgment Act was to allow a party to bring an action asserting his ‘nonliability’ in such a situation.”  REDACTED “Case and controversy” issues require analysis of the parties’ respective positions regarding the conduct in question. “[Mjajor stress should be placed on the ‘definite’ intention of plaintiff to take ‘immediate’ action to utilize its potential.” Wembley, Inc. v. Sperba Cravats, Inc., 315 F.2d 87, 90 (2nd Cir.1963). Plaintiff clearly evinces the desire and ability to provide the challenged services. Plaintiff claims that only defendant’s threats of prosecution prevent her from advertising and providing her services. The SGC investigated plaintiffs purported violation of Conn.Gen.Stat. § 51-88.

Appellant first contends that the district court erred in allowing into evidence Hancock’s guilty plea to the misdemeanor of assault and battery because it was hearsay and does not come within the exception to Federal Rules of Evidence 803(22) which permits hearsay evidence of final judgments entered on a plea of guilty.

"treating physician’s opinion controlling weight, he is required to consider several factors including the length, nature, and extent of the treatment relationship, frequency of examination, the physician’s specialty, the types of tests performed, and the consistency and supportability of the physician’s opinions. 20 C.F.R. § 404.1527(c)(2). While the ALJ acknowledged that Dr. Vidic is Newman’s treating neurologist, and in a different portion if his opinion noted that Newman went a full year without seeing Dr. Vidic, he does not discuss any of these required factors when explaining his decision only to give Dr. Vidic’s opinion “some weight.” [DE 12 at 26.] The ALJ’s failure to analyze this required checklist of factors is fatal to his partial rejection of Dr. Vidic’s opinion.  REDACTED In sum, I am unclear as to why the ALJ rejected the portion of Dr. Vidic’s opinion regarding manipulative limitations especially in light of the apparent longitudinal evidence supporting that opinion. The Seventh Circuit has “repeatedly stated that the ALJ’s decision must be based upon consideration of all the relevant evidence, and that the ALJ must articulate at some minimal level his analysis of the evidence.” Id.

"Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. It is so ordered. The INS’s immigration-enforcement functions are now handled by the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement in the Department of Homeland Security. See Clark v. Martinez, 543 U.

Over the years, courts have found certain types of contractual arrangements unreasonable as a matter of law, because they pose an unacceptable risk of stifling competition. Jefferson Parish Hospital District No. 2 v. Hyde, 466 U.S. 2, 9, 104 S.Ct. 1551, 1556, 80 L.Ed.2d 2 (1984). Courts presume that these “per se” illegal arrangements are unreasonable without inquiring as to whether the arrangement has had an anticompetitive effect in the relevant market. Jefferson Parish, 466 U.S. at 15-16, 104 S.Ct. at 1560; Brillhart v. Mutual Medical Insurance Co., 768 F.2d 196, 199 n. 2 (7th Cir.1985);  REDACTED  cert. denied, 470 U.S. 1054, 105 S.Ct. 1758, 84 L.Ed.2d 821 (1985). Anti-competitive effect is still a requirement in these cases; however, courts conclusively presume anticompetitive effect because the type of conduct complained of is obviously destructive of free competition.

It is apparent that the doctrine of entireties, because of its scope, can lead to two contrary conclusions depending on what criteria are given controlling effect. It is also apparent that no decision here advanced by the parties is dis-positive of the issue. Considering all of the evidence of record and the applicable law, we think the imported goods are more properly classified as entireties under paragraph 919 as articles of clothing n.s.p.f. Classification is determined by the condition of the articles at the time of importation.

When the parts of the merchandise are separated and either part is returned for credit, or when both parts are returned for credit, the parts of the unit are either given to charity or placed in the waste basket.

"exercise of pendent jurisdiction involves two issues: the court’s power to hear the state law claim and the proper exercise of its discretion in doing so. See United Mine Workers v. Gibbs, 383 U.S. 715, 86 S.Ct. 1130, 16 L.Ed.2d 218 (1966). Here, it is undisputed that the claims under the New York Human Rights Law derive from the same incidents as plaintiff’s Title VII claims; both sets of claims center on the incidents at the Fallsburg Police Department. Moreover, since it is not clear that state law issues will predominate, unsettled state laws will confuse the jury, or tricky state procedural issues will tangle up the case’s resolution, we find no serious obstacle to exercising pendent jurisdiction. See  REDACTED CONCLUSION To conclude, the court denies Defendant’s motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to join the proper employer as a party and to dismiss all allegations of incidents occurring more than 180 days before the EEOC complaint was filed. The court also denies Defendant’s request to dismiss the pendent state claims and the compensatory damages requests that accompany them. SO ORDERED. . The court notes that the Plaintiff did not name either the Town of Fallsburg or its Police Chief Robinson as co-defendants in this case.

Plaintiffs allege that Defendants Barnes, Lovell, and Henderson violated their Fourth Amendment rights to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures by invading and seizing numerous personal effects, office documents and materials from Salts Funeral Home without a search warrant. Neither Plaintiff was at the funeral home when the search occurred. The Fourth Amendment protects the “right of people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures-” U.S. Const. amend. IV. From this constitutional protection, it is well-established that a warrantless search and seizure is unreasonable absent probable cause and exigent circumstances. See Payton v.

Indeed, Plaintiffs make no allegation that the warrant was improper; rather they offer a blanket assertion that a search warrant was not presented to any officer of Salts Funeral Home.

Instead, the detainer merely notifies the prison that the INS has some interest in a particular inmate, and asks prison officials to advise the INS when the inmate is about to be released. Prieto, 913 F.2d at 1164; Orozco, 911 F.2d at 541, n. 2. That is also the case here. The detainer merely requests that INS be given advance notice of petitioner’s release from custody.

"this litigation. b. Reliance The fact that some of the proposed class representatives read and relied on the OS while others did not does not preclude class certification. Some named plaintiffs may have claims based only on the fraud-on-the-market theory, while other named plaintiffs also may have claims based on their reliance on the OS. In Kennedy, 710 F.2d at 717, the Eleventh Circuit indicated that the fraud-on-the-market claim by the named plaintiff, who did not read or rely on the prospectus, was not atypical even though other class members read and relied on the statement.

"of jurisdiction. Reed’s principal contention is that an honorable discharge is a valuable property right and that, under the Constitution, he may not be deprived of this right except in accord with due process of law as required by the Fifth Amendment. Ha asserts that a hearing prior to discharge, under the facts of this case, is a requirement of due process. The principal constitutional claim, as we understand it, is not that plaintiff has a right to stay in the Navy until he has served sufficient time to retire with a pension. Such claim, if asserted, would be frivolous and would provide no basis for the court’s jurisdiction to interfere with the normal operations of the military services. Plaintiff cites  REDACTED  and Burns v. Wilson, 346 U.S. 137, 73 S.Ct. 1045, 97 L.Ed. 1508, rehearing denied, 346 U.S. 844, 74 S.Ct. 3, 98 L.Ed. 363 (1953), in support of his contention that the court below had jurisdiction. In both of these cases, however, all other possible remedies had been exhausted prior to invoking jurisdiction of the District Court. In Harmon v. Brueker, supra, the Supreme Court construed language in an Army regulation which had been previously construed by the Secretary of the Army in a manner beyond his statutory grant of authority. It is plain that there was no reason for judicial action until after there had been an administrative construction of the regulation. In reversing the",755024

Although § 523(a)(8) is the sole mechanism by which debtors may seek discharge of student debt, it is not the only provision bearing on the dischargeability of student loans. [¶] Following [In re Myrvang, 232 F.3d 1116 (9th Cir.2000) ], it is now generally recognized that an all-or-nothing approach to the discharge-ability of student debt contravenes Congress’ intent in granting bankruptcy courts equitable authority to enforce the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, [footnote omitted] Under 11 U.S.C. § 105(a), bankruptcy courts may “issue any order, process or judgment that is necessary or appropriate to carry out the provisions” of the Bankruptcy Code.

Fourth, should the wage earner obtain a hardship discharge under § 1328(b), the exemptions must be considered by the Court in its determination as to whether the test of § 1328(b)(2) has been met. Finally, should a hardship discharge be granted, the discharge is only as to unsecured debts and the debtor would again be in a reaffirmation posture as to those debts secured by the nonpurchase money security interests in household goods. For these reasons this Court disagrees with the conclusions reached in In re Sands, 15 B.R. 563 (Bkrtcy.M.D.N.C.1981), In re Aycock, 15 B.R. 728 (Bkrtcy.D.N.C.1981), and  REDACTED Instead, this Court is in accord with In re Ohnstad, 6 B.C.D. 6 (Bkrtcy.D.S.D.1980) in which the Court found that a Chapter 13 debtor is entitled to claim the same exemptions allowed to a Chapter 7 debtor. 6 B.C.D. at 7.

Findings of the Hearing Examiner are clearly based upon sufficient evidence, as defined in Richardson v. Perales, supra, and Ginsburg v. Richardson, supra. The Hearing Examiner’s findings were based upon the uncontradicted testimony of the vocational expert, Dr. Morris M. Rubin. Dr. Rubin testified that “jobs of this nature exist in significant numbers”. He indicates that his opinion is based in part upon federal government bulletins, weekly and monthly occupational information, received from state employment services, local newspapers and trade journals.

Reed suggests that decisions subsequent to Almendarez-Torres, such as Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000); Blakely, 542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403; and  REDACTED  cast doubt over Almendarez-Torres’s validity. We have held, however, that, until the Supreme Court explicitly overrules Almendarez-Torres, it is still law that is binding upon this Court. United States v.

"for the personal use of the debtor, and (3) the debt was incurred within the 910-day period preceding the date of the filing of the petition, then section 506 is inapplicable and the entire amount of the creditor’s claim is secured.

Id. at *1 (citing  REDACTED Judge Funk ex plains his interpretation of this second scenario as follows: In the latter portion of the Amendment, Congress did not re-state the requirement that a creditor hold a purchase money security interest in order for section 506 not to apply to a debt secured by collateral, consisting of anything of value (other than a motor vehicle), incurred within 1-year of the filing date. However, the Court, in arriving at this interpretation, reads “that debt,” located in the second to the last clause of the Amendment following the comma and the disjunction “or,” to refer to “the debt” that is the subject of the claim secured by a purchase money security interest, stated in the beginning of the section.

"in Other Circuits After some changes of position, mostly by way of overruling earlier cases denying the power of review, the First, Third, Fourth, Sixth, Seventh, Ninth, Tenth and the District of Columbia Circuits “now recognize that they may reverse a judgment even though the only basis for review is the inadequacy or excessiveness of the verdict.” Moore, Vol. 6, pp. 3836-9.

That there is, at least on the surface, a wide difference of opinion need not surprise us. Common phrases are such as: “grossly excessive,” “inordinate,” “shocking to the judicial conscience,” “outrageously excessive,” “so large as to shock the conscience of the court,” “monstrous,” and many others.

They first assume that the labor-arbitration line of cases applies to arbitration awards controlled by the Federal Arbitration Act and that the two standards are roughly the same.

Fortunato, Jr., Esq.” Boudakian v. Boudakian, P89-2278, slip op. at 3 (R.I.Fam.Ct. Sept. 24, 1990). We view this award to be in the nature of alimony or support, in light of the reference by the Family Court to the former -wife’s modest financial means, and we have no difficulty reconciling this with the Family Court division of marital assets, supra. See In re Kranz, 100 B.R. at 477 (evidence that attorney fee award is in the nature of support may warrant such a finding). See also  REDACTED The pre-petition attorney fee debt is therefore non-dis-chargeable. C. The Claim of Karkour Khajadouri-an Finally, we address the question whether the $5,000 in the possession of the Debtor is dischargeable as to Karkour Khajadouri-an, under § 523. This-issue cannot be resolved by reference to the language of the Family Court order alone, although we begin our analysis there. Master O’Brien found that the $5,000 award to Karkour Khajadourian was “money that was entrusted to Sevan Boudakian for safe keeping and which ... has never been returned.” Boudakian v. Boudakian, P89-2278, slip op. at 2 (R.I.Fam.Ct. Sept. 24, 1990). There is no basis or need to disturb or alter that finding. However, it does not fully address, for our purposes, the",808832
"above: (1) overbreadth of the warrants and (2) no probable cause for their issuance. A. OVERBREADTH With regard to their contention of over-breadth, the defendants challenge two parts of the warrant, that which authorizes seizure of records pertaining to interstate shipment of films named in the indictment (substantive counts II to XVIII) and that relating to records which reflect the conspiracy (count I.) 1. SUBSTANTIVE RECORDS The section of the warrant describing papers to be seized because they pertain to named obscene films is quoted supra, at p. 130,. see sub. (b). It is similar to the language approved by the Fourth Circuit in United States v. Torch, 609 F.2d 1088 (4th Cir. 1979), and by the Ninth Circuit in  REDACTED This part of the warrant narrowly focuses on those papers which are part of transactions involving the specific films in the indictment. Jacobs approved a warrant authorizing seizure of “documents pertaining to the interstate shipment of obscene materials,” specifying a list of certain types of documents. Id. at 567. Torch found permissible a warrant calling for the seizure of “records, documents, and writings related to the transportation, sale and distribution in interstate commerce of” certain films, “including route book, cash sales slips, credit memos, and other similar type documents.” 609 F.2d at 1089.

See Carter v. Chrysler Corp., 173 F.3d 693, 700 (8th Cir.1999). Whether harassing conduct constitutes discrimination based on sex is determined by whether members of one sex are exposed to disadvantageous terms or conditions of employment to which members of the other sex are not exposed. Scusa v. Nestle U.S.A. Co., Inc., 181 F.3d 958, 965 (8th Cir.1999) (citing Montandon v. Farmland Indus., Inc., 116 F.3d 355, 358 (8th Cir.1997);  REDACTED Stated differently, the harassment must be based on the complaining person’s sex. Id.

Sundowner Offshore Serv., Inc., 523 U.S. 75, 81, 118 S.Ct. 998, 140 L.Ed.2d 201 (1998). There is no bright line between sexual harassment and merely unpleasant conduct, and not every aspect of a work environment characterized by hostility and intimidation need be explicitly sexual in nature to be probative.

But the Bankruptcy Court then turned to Rule 60(b), which allows a reasonable time (but not more than one year) within which to file a motion for relief from judgment based on excusable neglect, and found the requisite excusable neglect for Susan’s failure to make timely post-judgment motions. In the context of excusable neglect as a ground for relief from a judgment or order, Rule 60(b) is appropriately invoked to offer excuses for neglect leading up to the judgment in the first place, not excuses for neglect for failure to file post-judgment motions to alter or amend. Sanders v. Clemco Indus., 862 F.2d 161, 168 n. 14 (8th Cir.1988); see, e.g.,  REDACTED In re King, 165 B.R. 296 (Bankr.M.D.Fla.1994) (seeking rehearing under Rule 60(b) for order granting motion to value collateral where creditor failed to respond); Elliot v.

Schlumberger then dismissed with prejudice its counterclaims. The issue of inequitable conduct was tried to the Court from August 7 to August 28, 1989. II. INEQUITABLE CONDUCT A. The Duty of Disclosure Prosecuting a patent application in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (“PTO”) is normally an ex parte procedure conducted in secret with no notice or information provided to competitors or the public until the patent has been approved for issuance. 35 U.S.C. § 122; 37 C.F.R. § 1.14;  REDACTED To preserve the integrity of the patent process, the PTO must be able to rely on the disclosures and other statements of the applicant and his attorney. During the prosecution of a patent the applicant and his attorney therefore occupy a relationship of trust to the PTO and are obligated to exercise the highest standards of honesty, good faith and candor. 37 C.F.R. § 1.56(a); Hycor Corp. v. Schlueter Co., 740 F.2d 1529, 1538 (Fed. Cir.1984). The applicant and his attorney must disclose to the PTO “information they are aware of which is material to the examination of the application.” 37 C.F.R. § 1.56(a).

We agree with the following statement by a district court faced with a similar situation: When a plaintiff chooses a state forum, yet also elects to press federal claims, he runs the risk of removal. A federal forum for federal claims is certainly a defendant's right. If a state forum is more important to the plaintiff than his federal claims, he should have to make that assessment before the case is jockeyed from state court to federal court and back to state court.

Kansas courts have rarely found conduct to be sufficiently outrageous to survive summary judgment, and those claims which have survived involved highly shocking and egregious conduct such as repeated physical threats and racially or sexually abusive language. See Lawyer v. Eck & Eck Mach., Co., Inc., 197 F.Supp.2d 1267, 1276-77 (D.Kan.2002); Ratts v. Bd. of County Comm’rs, Harvey County, Kan., 141 F.Supp.2d 1289, 1322 (D.Kan.2001);  REDACTED In evaluating whether plaintiff has alleged conduct which is sufficiently outrageous to survive summary judgment, the Court notes that plaintiff has alleged numerous acts of misconduct by non-supervisory employees such as Fielder and Sommerset and asserted that these acts are sufficient to show that Baron’s conduct was outrageous. Baron is not vicariously liable, however, for the intentional acts of its salespeople — plaintiffs co-workers. See Bolden, 43 F.3d at 553-54; Farris v.

"claim. II. Discussion We review the constitutionality of a statute, which is a question of law, de novo. United States v. Olofson, 563 F.3d 652, 659 (7th Cir.2009). Moore challenges the constitutionality of the crack-powder disparity, which was enacted as part of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 and remained the law at the time he was sentenced, on two grounds. First, Moore argues that the 100-to-l ratio is arbitrary and irrational, in violation of his right to substantive due process. Second, Moore contends that the crack-powder disparity has a disparate impact on African-American defendants, in violation of the Equal Protection clause of the Fifth Amendment. Moore concedes that we have considered and rejected similar arguments in the past, see  REDACTED United States v.

A literal reading of § 9-103. l(2)(b) indicates that it should be applied whenever a certificate of title is issued by a foreign jurisdiction, which, as a condition of perfection, requires notation of the security interest on the certificate of title. Illinois does in fact require “indication on a certificate of title as a condition of perfection” and therefore, would appear to satisfy the requirement. The Trustee cites In re Paige  REDACTED The case is reported at 3 B.R. 115 and concluded that the debtor was a nonresident (resident of Michigan), and an Illinois certificate of title was not required under UCC § 9-103(4), and thus the multiple state transactions provision was inapplicable.

Kriescher also reasserts on appeal that she was fired on the basis of her age and sex. She argues primarily that Dove’s stated reasons for firing her were pretextual.

In both instances the Board explained that the whereby clause defines the result of administering an effective amount of GAA rather than constituting a separate step of a method. Genzyme’s second claim construction argument is that the whereby clause should be construed to require that the reduction of glycogen occur in the patient’s skeletal muscles, rather than occurring anywhere in the patient’s body, including the heart, skeletal muscles, or liver. In an inter partes review, the Board accords unexpired claims their broadest reasonable interpretation consistent with the specification.  REDACTED  cert. granted, — U.S. -, 136 S.Ct. 890, 193 L.Ed.2d 783 (2016). The broadest reasonable construction of the whereby- clause encompasses a reduction of accumulated glycogen anywhere in the patient, rather than necessarily in the skeletal muscles, as Genzyme argues. As the Board noted in its final written decisions, “the claim does not recite specific organs or tissue, does not recite any specific form of Pompe disease, and does not require, for example, the patient to experience an increased life-span. The whereby clause merely requires the reduction or arrest of glycogen in the patient.” Because the claim language does not expressly or implicitly-require that the administration of GAA reduce glycogen in any particular organ of the body, the Board",794001

The Strickland standard “provides sufficient guidance for resolving virtually all ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims.” Lewis v.

In Lewis, the most recent instance in which we performed this kind of analysis, we sought to determine whether the Supreme Court’s decision in  REDACTED  holding that counsel has a duty to consult with his client about taking an appeal under certain circumstances, announced a new rule. We found that it did not, and in doing so, discussed in some detail the appropriate retroactivity analysis for cases involving Strickland. Looking to the intersection of Strickland and Teague, we made three observations that guide the “new rule” inquiry: (1) “case law need not exist on all fours to allow for a finding under Teague that the rule at issue was dictated by ... precedent,” Leuns, 359 F.3d at 655; (2) “Strickland is a rule of general applicability which asks whether counsel’s conduct was objectively reasonable and conformed to professional norms based",667177

Under the second, § 1503’s omnibus clause (the underscored language) applies to the destruction or concealment of documents in criminal investigations. Cases involving prosecutions for document destruction during civil pre-trial discovery are notably absent from the extensive body of reported § 1503 case law.

United States, 124 F.Supp. 636, 637-638, 129 Ct.Cl. 464, 466 (1954), the district court suit was still pending and there was no reason at all to believe that that tribunal lacked jurisdiction. In those circumstances this court refused to defer action pending the outcome of the suit in the district court but applied 28 U.S.C. § 1500 to dismiss the Court of Claims suit at once. In Los Angeles Shipbuilding & Drydock Corp. v. United States, 152 F.Supp. 236,138 Ct.Cl. 648 (1957), the district court plainly had jurisdiction of the claim and this court held that the plaintiff had elected that tribunal as the desired forum over the Court of Claims.  REDACTED  also involved another pending suit clearly within the jurisdiction of the district court in which it was brought. All of these cases, and the others involving Section 1500, were quite different from this case in its present posture. Plaintiffs’ motions for rehearing are granted, the dismissal without prejudice of plaintiffs’ petition ordered on October 1, 1965, is vacated and set aside, defendant’s motion to dismiss the petition is denied, and the case is returned to the trial commissioner for further proceedings.

"in § 101(25A), suggests a single date and meant [sic] the “due date for commencement of performance,” but Congress did not intend to restrict the number of times a forward contract can mature. Renew Energy, at 480. In Renew Energy, the court looked at the actual delivery dates, and concluded that the contract under which delivery was actually made within two days of contracting was not a forward contract within the safe harbor of § 546(e). In support of his argument that “maturity date” means the date on which performance could commence, the trustee relies on cases that say that a forward contract must require delivery more than two days after the date of the contract. See, e.g.,  REDACTED In re MBS Mgmt. Servs., Inc., 432 B.R. 570 (Bankr.E.D.La.2010), aff'd, 2011 WL 1899764 (E.D.La. May 19, 2011); In re Borden Chemicals and Plastics Operating Ltd.

Finally, the supervisor-to-employee ratio provides little guidance; if Mr. Wilson was a supervisor, at times the store had as many as five persons supervising six employees; on the other hand, if Mr. Wilson wasn’t a supervisor, Saturday night found the store with no supervisors at all.

From this letter, in other words, it is plain that Henke assumed Powers did not know of Henke’s expectation of guaranteed payment. Nothing he has produced in the interim points to a contrary finding. Not every expression of intention takes on contractual gravitas. See 1 Restatement (Second) Contracts § 2 (1981).

Moreover, when the parties’ promissory statements are made with materially different meanings, not known to the other party, no contract arises.

The most generous reading of the evidence Henke has put forward is that Powers agreed that, if the mission was successful, he and Reina were committed to trying to get Henke paid.

"the light most favorable to Ford, that to the extent that the Third Circuit would recognize the state-created danger theory as a viable theory of constitutional recovery, Ford has alleged sufficient facts to establish a prima facie case of state-created danger. I therefore will deny Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss with respect to this claim. While Plaintiff addresses the issue of the liability of the agencies and policymakers in her brief, Defendants do not raise this issue in their motion and absent complete briefing, we will not address the issue at this time. Defendants may, however, raise the issue at summary judgment regarding whether Plaintiff has sustained a cause of action against the agencies and policymakers for § 1983 liability. See e.g.  REDACTED Although Ford has attached documents in support of her motion, we will not consider these submissions for the purpose of deciding this motion to dismiss. See Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b) (“If, on a motion asserting the defense numbered (6) ... matters outside the pleading are presented to and not excluded by the court, the motion shall be treated as one for summary judgment and disposed of as provided in Rule 56 ...)”.

"stems from an example often cited under the Rehabilitation Act: A person with acrophobia who receives nine offers for employment as an accountant that she could accept, but must turn down a tenth offer because the office is on the 37th floor, is not deemed disabled. See Forrisi, 794 F.2d at 934-35; E.E. Black, Ltd. v.

Leslie’s situation is not comparable to the example, for she clearly could not perform a wide range of jobs as a resident attendant or with comparable duties involving lifting patients. However, New Hope derives from  REDACTED  and Marschand v. Norfolk & Western Ry. Co., 876 F.Supp. 1528, 1538 (N.D.Ind.1995), a much heavier burden on ADA plaintiffs to produce evidence to show a “substantial limitation” in working.

"The Instructions set out relevant characteristics, including experience with installing additions to existing structures and large mechanical and electrical systems, handling challenges in staging materials and site access to prominent locations, and renovations in occupied building spaces. Plaintiff argues that such characteristics of comparability were merely “benchmarks,” not mandatory minimum requirements. The Agency may not have considered them mandatory, but merely exemplary of attributes suggesting experience sufficient for the job. In any event, a court will not substitute its judgment for that of a contracting officer in such circumstances. See, e.g., ManTech Telecom. & Information Sys. Corp. v.

Fru-Con’s proposal was essentially a compilation of generic material that it had submitted for other projects. As a result, it omitted important information required by the Solicitation Instructions and the evaluation criteria. The Selection Board found that plaintiff did not address most of the issues emphasized in the Request for Proposals. Moreover, Fru-con did not produce the information in an organized fashion. The Agency reported that this forced them to search through the proposal to find some information that it needed.

The plaintiff [here] has not been injured by a contract, express or implied, which sought to prevent him from dealing in the goods of any competitor of the defendant. Id. at 915-16. In the case at bar the plaintiff also has not been harmed by such a contract, because whether or not a contract for sale existed between the parties, it is undisputed that Central received no goods under the contract.

"management would consider inimical to its interests. But the discretionary authority conferred by the Legislature upon the Commissioner of Transportation clearly contemplates his official discretion will be used in weighing the public interest when he decides to spend the State’s money for transportation subsidies. That discretion is not transferred to the bargaining parties through any requirement imposed by federal labor law; the policy of permitting and encouraging free collective bargaining does not require that the Commissioner surrender his responsibility for the subsidy program to the vagaries of the collective bargaining process. The unemployment compensation cases of ITT Lamp Division v.

Both cases involved the exercise of State decisions whether to pay various benefits to striking workers. The issue presented in those cases was the asserted intrusion of State economic power in strengthening the economic position of striking workers. These decisions highlight the different issues raised here. We do not have here a question of State intervention to strengthen or weaken one or the other party to the negotiating process.

See also Thornburgh v. Abbott, supra, — U.S. -, 109 S.Ct. at 1880, 104 L.Ed.2d at 471.

On December 17, 2009, the court sentenced Alen to forty-eight months in prison and three years of supervised release. Alen has timely noted this appeal, and we possess jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291. II. We assess de novo the legal determinations underlying a district court’s suppression rulings, including the denial of a Franks hearing, and we review the court’s factual findings relating to such rulings for clear error. See United States v. Blatstein, 482 F.3d 725, 730 (4th Cir.2007). A determination of probable cause is an issue of law that is reviewed de novo. See  REDACTED III. On appeal, Alen makes three contentions. First, he maintains that the district court erred in denying his request for a Franks hearing on the inaccurate statements contained in Detective Wade’s affidavit supporting the First Warrant. Second, he asserts that the First Warrant is void because Detective Niedermeier’s warrantless entry into the AFA Store was not justified by exigent circumstances. Finally, Alen contends that Agent Slackman’s affidavit supporting the Third Warrant was insufficient to justify a probable cause finding, and that the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule, see United States v. Leon, 468 U.S. 897, 104 S.Ct. 3405, 82 L.Ed.2d 677 (1984), does not apply. We assess Alen’s contentions in turn. A. Alen contends that the district court",437434

Cf. United States v. Centracchio, 236 F.3d 812, 813-14 (7th Cir.2001) (alluding to a concern that the Government may not appeal a suppression determination once jeopardy attaches). In this situation, permitting the defendant to pursue his suppression motion does not implicate the social costs associated with granting a mo tion to suppress that is raised after a jury has been sworn or that is raised for the first time on appeal.

"that he sold Slayton substantial quantities of both powder cocaine and crack cocaine. Nor does the evidence, taken as a whole, support Slayton’s argument that the conspiracy was hindered by the conversations. Thus, a reasonable jury could conclude, based on the evidence presented, that these phone conversations facilitated the ongoing conspiracy to distribute powder cocaine and crack cocaine, even if no agreement was reached in the conversations themselves. III. We now turn to Slayton’s challenge to his conviction on Counts Fourteen and Seventeen. In his brief, Slayton argues that a material variance occurred between the indictment and the evidence presented at trial because the indictment contained incorrect times for the recorded phone conversations.

The allowance of claims 21, 22 and 23 is of no significance here, even if it seems to be inconsistent with the rejection of claim 4.  REDACTED 60 USPQ 202. It certainly proves nothing with respect to appellant’s disclosure.

It did so, and that motion and defendant’s response thereto, which consisted of a partial motion for dismissal, have been briefed. See supra note 2. In addition, plaintiff paid the $100 per-calendar-day sanction imposed by the May 7, 1984, order, except for the period when it was relieved from doing so by this court. After a protracted delay, this case is unlike  REDACTED  wherein the Fifth Circuit ruled that the trial court should have considered a lesser sanction than dismissal with prejudice when plaintiff failed to file a response to defendant’s motion for three months and declared that period not the “extreme delay” that warrants dismissal with prejudice.

"her investment goals with less risk. Based on various points during a nine-month period when Hermann claimed Rollins could have taken such corrective action, Hermann identified different possible starting values for calculating damages. Using these starting values, Hermann calculated how a properly managed portfolio would have performed (assuming the same level of withdrawals), and then subtracted the actual ending value of the account. Based on these calculations, Hermann concluded that the loss attributable to Rollins’ mismanagement was between $244,495 and $505,395. Rollins does not dispute that the general method used by Hermann to calculate damages—comparing actual investment results to those that could have been achieved had the account been properly managed—is generally accepted and reliable. See, e.g.,  REDACTED Rollins argues, however, that Hermann improperly deviated from this method by using a starting point other than the value of the account when it was first opened. The district court rejected this argument, finding that Hermann’s methodology was sufficiently reliable in light of his testimony that Rollins committed multiple breaches of duty and that one of those breaches was his failure to take corrective action to preserve Parmenter’s account after it had appreciated. The decision by the district court to admit Hermann’s damages testimony was not an abuse of discretion.

For these reasons, Johns-Man-ville’s motion for judgment n. o. v. on the asserted ground of insufficient evidence will be denied. Secondly, Johns-Manville contends that punitive damages cannot be assessed in mass tort litigation because multiple punitive damage awards will annihilate or bankrupt a corporation. This argument has its genesis from dicta in  REDACTED In Roginsky, the Second Circuit reversed an award of punitive damages against a defendant drug manufacturer who had been sued in hundreds of cases nationwide due to its distribution of a drug named MER/29 which caused cataracts in unsuspecting patients. The court affirmed the jury’s verdict insofar that it awarded compensatory damages to the plaintiff but reversed the award of punitive damages because of insufficient evidence of “complicity.” In dictum, Judge Friendly expressed the fear that recovery of punitive damages in multiple tort actions might serve to bankrupt the tortfeasor corporation and end the business life of a company because of a.single management sin. 378 F.2d at 838-841.

"be administered as a single estate under a single chapter of the Bankruptcy Code.” Under this view, a debtor is barred from filing a Chapter 13 petition before the Chapter 7 case is closed, even if the debtor has already received a discharge in the Chapter 7 case. A minority of courts, however, have declined to adopt a per se rule against such simultaneous filings and have permitted a debtor to file a second petition under Chapter 13 to reorganize the debts that have survived the Chapter 7 discharge, before the closing of the Chapter 7 case, provided the debtor had already received the Chapter 7 discharge.

For example, probable cause that the property was either purchased with the proceeds of drug offenses or was used to commit or facilitate the violation of various drug statutes. In each case, the elements of the claim focus on specific property. In contrast, none of the criminal statutes require the use of any specific property to prove guilt. Thus, the civil claim has an element not shared by the criminal statutes. Consequently, it is not possible to find that the civil forfeiture and the criminal prosecution are identical offenses. See  REDACTED The only alternative allowed by Dixon would be a finding that one was a lesser offense and the other a greater offense. Clearly, the criminal offense could not be the greater because it does not completely include the elements of the civil forfeiture, the involvement of property. Therefore, some cases conclude, without analysis, that the civil forfeiture must be the greater offense and the criminal offenses must be lesser included offenses. See, e.g., United States v.

Second, the majority’s opinion defeats Congress’s desire to eradicate employment discrimination in which an employer retaliates against an employee, or former employee, for participating in a Title VII investigation. The pertinent question in anti-discrimination cases is whether the employer was motivated by a discriminatory animus at the time of the adverse employment action against the employee. This is the clear holding of a unanimous Supreme Court in  REDACTED McKennon held that after-acquired evidence of a legitimate basis for an employee’s termination could not shield an employer from liability under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (“ADEA”). The Court found that after-acquired evidence was relevant only to the question of the remedy to which the employee was entitled. Id. at 360-62, 115 S.Ct. 879.

"writ is not available in federal courts for errors of law”). Sawyer contends that the writ is proper to redress legal error, while the government contends it may be granted to vacate a conviction based on mistakes of fact only. The district court agreed with Sawyer on this point, ruling that the writ is available to correct legal error. In deciding whether to grant the writ, courts have used a, three-part test: a petitioner must 1) explain her failure to seek relief from judgment earlier, 2) demonstrate continuing collateral consequences from the conviction, and 3) prove that the error is fundamental to the validity of the judgment. See Hager v. United States, 993 F.2d 4, 5 (1st Cir.1993); see also  REDACTED United States v. Barrett, 178 F.3d 34, 56 n. 20 (1st Cir.1999).

School Board of the City of Richmond, Va., 345 F.2d 310 (4th Cir. 1965) vacated and remanded on other grounds, 382 U.S. 103, 86 S.Ct. 224, 15 L.Ed.2d 187 (1965) (freedom of choice plan);  REDACTED ., 103, 86 S.Ct. 224, 15 L.Ed.2d 187 (1965) (geographical zoning plan). The school authorities have the primary responsibility for initiating plans to achieve a lawful school system. Brown v. Board of Education, 349 U.S. 294, 299, 75 S.Ct. 753, 99 L.Ed. 1083 (1955). This circuit has recognized that local authorities should be accorded considerable discretion in charting a route to a constitutionally adequate school system. Freedom of choice plans are not in themselves invalid. They may, however, be invalid because the “freedom of choice” is illusory. The plan must be tested not only by its provisions, but by the manner in which it operates to provide opportunities for a desegregated education. In",77962
"“literally true” is a question of fact for the determination of a jury. See United States v. Lighte, 782 F.2d 367, 373 (2d Cir.1986). Similarly, O’Connell’s argument that the questions posed were “fun-, damentally ambiguous” amounts to a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence relied upon by the jury in reaching its guilty verdict. Id. at 375. Our standard of review is, consequently, deferential, with-all inferences to be credited to the government and a weighty burden to be borne by O’Connell. United States v. Diaz, 176 F.3d 52, 89 (2d Cir.1999). O’Connell relies upon Bronston v. United States, 409 U.S. 352, 93 S.Ct. 595, 34 L.Ed.2d 568 (1973), and its application by this Court to § 1001 prosecutions, see  REDACTED  in arguing that his response to the question of a government inspector was “literally true.” That reliance is misplaced. In Bronston, the defendant’s reply to a question was literally true but non-responsive—ie., the .defendant was asked whether he had Swiss bank accounts and responded by saying that “[t]he company had an account therej’ without admitting to his own Swiss account. Bronston, 409 U.S. at 354, 93 S.Ct. 595. Here, however, O’Connell’s answer to the government inspector was not so oblique.

Second, once the defendant has made out a prima facie case, the burden shifts to the State to explain adequately the racial exclusion by offering permissible race-neutral justifications for the strikes. Third, if a race-neutral explanation is tendered, the trial court must then decide ... whether the opponent of the strike has proved purposeful racial discrimination. Johnson v.
